{'january 1': [['NATIONAL HANGOVER DAY', '\n\n    \nNational Hangover Day - January 1\nNATIONAL HANGOVER DAY\nNational Hangover Day is observed annually on January 1st.  The day follows New Years Eve, a day that traditionally is spent celebrating to bring in the New Year.\nSymptoms of a Hangover\n\nFeeling tired: Alcohol is a toxin. Our bodies are designed to metabolize toxins (alcohol) at a certain pace.  When the pace of consumption exceeds the pace the liver can process it we become intoxicated and at a substantially higher risk for a hangover.  As the liver breaks down alcohol, it produces the toxic chemical acetaldehyde.  One of the substances the body produces to counter these toxins is glutathione.  The body can only make so much at a time and can be quickly depleted during a night of drinking.  Glutathione is a stimulant and when its depleted, we feel tired.\nUpset stomach:  Alcohol promotes secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomach.  Excessive amounts of hydrochloric acid can lead to a queasy stomach, diarrhea or vomiting.\nHeadache or muscle aches: Alcohol is a diuretic.  Dehydration can lead to aches and pains as well as the upset stomach listed above.\n\nHow to Prevent that Hangover\n\nEat - A fat and protein loaded meal before or during the first round of drinks will slow the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream. No, the food doesnt act a sponge, soaking up the alcohol, but it does slow down the digestive process. Fats and especially proteins, take longer to digest and the alcohol will be released more slowly into the bloodstream.\nDrink water - Keep hydrated between beers or shots by drinking a glass of water in between.  This will dilute the alcohol, give the liver time to keep up and replace the fluids lost.\nAvoid diet cocktails - According to WebMD studies show cocktails mixed with fruits, fruit juices or other sugar-containing beverages lessen the intensity of a hangover.\nPace yourself - The saying, Beer then liquor, never been sicker. Liquor then beer, have no fear has more to do with the amount of alcohol consumed than the type. Beer tends to be consumed more quickly than hard liquor and as the night goes on, each successive drink tends to go down easier. Starting with liquor and then switching to beer half way through, one might drink more beer, but less total alcohol than if the process is reversed.\n\nHangover Cures\nThe only sure fire cure for a hangover is time and lots of fluids.  There are some common remedies that may help ease the symptoms, and there are others that only delay recovery.\n\nThe most common cure is called a hair of the dog that bit you.  This suggests that having some of what caused the hangover will help cure it.  This will only delay recovery as it will further tax the liver, increase the secretion of hydrochloric acid and will not replace any of the fluids already lost to last nights revelry.\nEat a banana.  Bananas are high in potassium.  This is nutrient that is lost while consuming alcohol.  Potassium loss contributes to muscle aches and cramps.  Eating a banana will help ease these symptoms.\nIn the movies, a strong cup of coffee is often shoved into the hands of the hangover victim in hopes of bringing some life back into them.  Coffee is a diuretic and while it may stimulate the body temporarily, the effect doesnt last and will only delay recovery.\nDrinking plenty of water* during the party and replacing fluids after can help ease the symptoms of a hangover. Rehydrate with water or also try fruit juices and sports drinks.  These will replace electrolytes which have been lost and also help recover from low blood sugar.  Studies have shown that alcohol consumption has a direct correlation to an increase in insulin.\nPain relievers may be the logical choice for that pounding headache which is a common symptom of a hangover. However, they also tax the already overworked liver.  If a pain reliever is necessary, aspirin will have the least effect on the liver but can irritate the stomach.  Either way, pain relievers may delay recovery more than ease the symptoms.\nOver-the-counter miracle cures may seem too good to be true, and they probably are.  Most of them require each pill to be taken with large quantities of water.  See * above about re-hydration.  These products may help ease the symptoms, but at an unnecessary expense.\nEating a meal with complex carbohydrates, protein and a little fat can help ease the symptoms of a hangover.  Whole wheat toast can absorb some of the acid the stomach is producing.  A fried egg can give the stomach something else to do instead of producing acid and also replaces some nutrients the body lost during the party binge.\nKeegan Calligar holding the Proclamation for National Hangover Day.\n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nUse #NationalHangOverDay when posting on Social Media.\nHISTORY\nAt a get together at the Oven and Tap, a restaurant in Bentonville, Arkansas in October 2015, people were talking about National Days.

Smith, the Bloody Mary made its debut in Paris at The Ritz Hotel in 1921. Originally named the Bucket of Blood, it also went by the name Red Snapper. Petiot later left Paris and introduced the vodka, tomato juice, lemon juice, Worcestershire, cayenne and salt cocktail to the New York King Cole Bar scene when prohibition ended.\nSome attribute the name to notorious Queen Mary Tudor who executed hundreds of Protestants in the name of Catholicism during her short five-year reign from 1553 to 1558. Others claim Petiots girlfriend of the same name receives the credit.\nTodays Bloody Marys include a variety of ingredients from pickles, olives and celery to bacon, horseradish, tobacco and peppers\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nEnjoy a Bloody Mary.

Buffets are useful for feeding large groups of individuals at one time and are offered at a variety of places including hotels, restaurants and conventions.\nOriginating during the middle of the 16th century, the buffet table comes from the Brannvinsbord - Swedish schnapps (shot of alcoholic beverage) table.  The prime of this custom was during the early 18th century and was developed into the more modern buffet around the beginning of the 19th century.  It was during the expansion of the railroads throughout Europe that the smorgasbord buffet increased in popularity.\nOriginally, the smorgasbord  table was a meal where guests gathered before dinner for a pre-dinner drink and was separate from the formal dinner that followed.\nIn 1939 at the New York Worlds Fair exhibition, the Swedes used a smorgasbord to showcase the best of the Swedish food to the large number of visitors attending the fair.  It was in the second half of the 20th century after the Swedes had popularized the smorgasbord in New York, where the word buffet became popular in the English-speaking world.\nThe term buffet originally referred to the French sideboard furniture where food was served from, however it eventually became applied to the serving format.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nHead out to your favorite buffet style restaurant and use #NationalBuffetDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nWithin our research, we were unable to identify the origin of National Buffet Day.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

Spaghetti dishes are traditionally served topped with grated hard cheeses such as Pecorino Romano, Parmesan and Grana Padano.\nThe word spaghetti is plural for the Italian word spaghetto, which is a diminutive of spago, meaning thin  string or twine.\nAmerican restaurants offered Spaghetti around the end of the 19th century as Spaghetti Italienne (which is believed to have consisted of noodles cooked past al dente and a mild tomato sauce flavored with easily found spices and vegetables such as cloves, bay leaves and garlic). Decades later, oregano and basil were added to many recipes.\nThere is significant debate on the origin of spaghetti. However, we do know that pasta has been consumed for many many years.  There are records in the Jerusalem Talmud of itrium, a kind of boiled dough, commonly available in Palestine from the 3rd to 5th centuries AD.

In an 1154 writing for the Norman King of Sicily, itriyya is mentioned being manufactured and exported from Norman Sicily.  Dried pasta became popular in the 14th and 15th centuries due to its easy storage.  People were able to store the dried pasta in ships when exploring the New World.

Our skin is first to notice.\nJoshua Zeichner MD, Director of Cosmetic & Clinical Research at The Mount Sinai Hospital, makes a few recommendations to help us keep our skin hydrated through the winter. When the chill sets in, avoid the temptation to take those long, hot showers. The heat strips skin of its natural oils (called ceramides) and causes inflammation. Causing the skin cells to swell, when they dry they become loose like poorly grouted tiles and crack.\nInstead, take shorter, lukewarm showers and use gentle cleansers. Harsh soaps with surfactants and claims of pH balance can be harsh on the skin. And dont scrub! Be tender and let the water and lather do the work.\nIf you have dry, cracked skin, look for a cream or ointment with light petrolatum, hyaluronic acid and ceramides - the natural fats that make up the grout between the skin cell tiles.  ~ Joshua Zeichner MD\nAfter bathing, pat the skin dry with a soft towel. Rubbing causes more irritation and inflammation. With the door closed to keep the humidity in, add a moisturizer.\nWhen dressing, wear layers. The closest layer should be made of natural fibers. Soft fabrics like flannel and cotton cause little to no irritation compared to synthetic materials. Layers also are more effective against cold weather.\nWinter skin relief comes many forms. Our skin needs hydration at night, too. Adding humidity to the air with a cool mist humidifier will not only hydrate your skin but will also provide a more restful sleep.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nUse #WinterSkinReliefDay to share on social media.\nHISTORY\nThe makers of CeraVe Skincare founded National Winter Skin Relief Day to bring awareness to all the extra attention winter skin needs.  \nAbout Valeant Consumer Healthcare:\nValeant Consumer Healthcare is a division of Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America LLC.

Static electricity is produced when the positive and negative charges of an atom are out of balance.\nThe atoms of some materials hold their electrons tightly. These materials, such as plastic, cloth or glass, are insulators. The electrons of these substances do not move very freely.\nThe electrons of other materials, such metal, move more freely and are called conductors.\nBy rubbing two insulators together, we transfer electrons causing positive and negative charges. Opposites do attract. Atoms with a positive charge become attracted to atoms with a negative charge. We can see the evidence if we rub a balloon head.  When the balloon is pulled away, the hair clings to the balloon.\nRemove the balloon and the hair may stand on end. In this circumstance, the hair has the same charge (either positive or negative). Items with the same charge repel each other.\nAt some point, these charges need to be put back in balance, and the static electricity is discharged. The release or the resulting shock occurs when an insulator comes in contact with a conductor, such as a piece of metal.\nHow to Avoid the Shock of Static Electricity\n\nThe drier air of winter months is a better insulator than the more humid air of summer.  To help prevent static electricity, use a humidifier to put moister back into the air in your home during the winter months.\nOur skin is drier in the winter months, too.  Putting on moisturizer before getting dressed is recommended.\nSynthetic fabrics are better insulators than natural fibers. Wearing fabrics made from natural fibers such as cotton will help reduce the amount of static electricity thats stirred up.\nWhile walking around the house, at work or shopping, holding a key or a metal pen in your hand will help discharge the build up of static electricity painlessly.\nSwitching to leather soled shoes versus rubber soled shoes will help reduce the amount of static that is built up.\n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nUse #StaticElectricityDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nWithin our research, we were unable to identify the creator of National Static Electricity Day.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

Farris.\n   The females of all mammal species can by definition produce milk, but cow milk dominates commercial production. In 2011, FAO estimates  85% of all milk worldwide was produced from cows.   \n   Aside from cattle, many kinds of livestock provide milk used by humans for dairy products. These animals include buffalo, goat, sheep, camel, donkey, horse, reindeer and yak.\n   Milk is processed into a variety of dairy products such as cream, butter, yogurt, kefir, ice cream and cheese.\n    Modern industrial processes use milk to produce casein, whey protein, lactose, condensed milk, powdered milk and many other food-additive and industrial products.\n   World Milk Day is celebrated on June 1.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nHave a nice, big glass of milk.

Instead, chicken is stewed in a sauce made from clarified butter (known as ghee) onions, garlic and a variety of spices such as cumin, coriander, cinnamon, ginger and tumeric. Other ingredients include chilies and tomatoes.\nCurries came into favor as an excellent way of using up cold meat. Lizzie Collingham Curry: A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors\nCurry powder made its way into recipes by way of Britain.

This is in Bengal the name of a peculiar dry kind of curry, often served as a breakfast dish. We can only conjecture that it was a favourite dish at the table of the skippers of country ships, who were themselves called country captains, as in our first quotation. In Madras the term is applied to a spatchcock dressed with onions and curry stuff, which is probably the original form. [Riddell says: Country-captain. Cut a fowl in pieces; shred an onion small and fry it brown in butter; sprinkle the fowl with fine salt and curry powder and fry it brown; then put it into a stewpan with a pint of soup; stew it slowly down to a half and serve it with rice (Ind. Dom. Econ. 176).]\n\n\n1792. But now, Sir, a Country Captain is not to be known from an ordinary man, or a Christian, by any certain mark whatever. Madras Courier, April 26.\n\n\nc. 1825.

Although it is often made into sweets such as marzipan-filled chocolate and small imitations of fruits and vegetables, it is also commonly rolled into thin sheets and used as a glaze for icing cakes.  Marzipan is also known to be shaped into small figures of animals, which in some countries is a favorite tradition on New Years Day.\nTo begin the production of marzipan, raw almonds are cleaned (by sieving, air elutriation and other electronic or mechanical devices) and then immersed in water with a temperature just below the boiling point for about five minutes.  This process loosens the skin of the almonds, which is removed by passing them through rubber-covered rotating cylinders.  The almonds are then cooked, coarsely chopped and ground (with up to 35% sugar) into almond flour. \nSugar and possibly a binding agent such as corn syrup or sorbitol are added to the almond flour mixture which has been roasted and cooled.

From that point onward, popcorn, specifically Cracker Jack, became forever married to the game.\nPopcorn has another romance that may have had a slow start, but eventually took off. Today, who can image going to the movies without getting a box of buttered popcorn. While popcorn itself was an economical choice for a snack food, the expense of installing a machine and venting the building properly didnt seem worth the effort.  If it wasnt for Glen W. Dickson, we would be purchasing our popcorn from a vendor on the street before taking in the show. Dickson put in the effort and expense of placing machines inside his theaters. After realizing how quickly he recouped his costs, other theater owners followed suit.\nThen next big advancement for popcorn was the invention of the microwave. Magnetrons, a technology produced by Raytheon Manufacturing Corporation for the military during World War II, were later used to develop microwave ovens. Percy Spencer was the man who made it happen. Popcorn was one of his primary experiments during the microwaves development.\nToday, Americans consume 13 billion quarts of popcorn a year, more than any other country in the world. A majority of the popcorn produced in the world is grown in the United States. Nebraska leads the corn belt in popcorn production.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nIn 2017, the Registrar at National Day Calendar has declared the Official Popcorn of National Popcorn Day to be Colorado Jack Popcorn.

January 20th is a gouda day to kummin over and have some cheddar or asiago or fontina! Its National Cheese Lovers Day.\nThere is no firm evidence on how cheese making was discovered, but legend tells us it was likely chance that the first cheese was created. Thousands of years ago, milk was transported and stored in sheep stomachs. Left to sit a few days the proteins would separate into curds and whey.\nFrom there, preserving the solids with salt may have seemed a logical next step. Salt was a highly valued preservative in ancient times.\nThe earliest record of cheese making dates back to 5,500 BCE in what is now Poland.  Today there are over 1,400 varieties of cheese.\nThe basic principles behind making cheese are quite simple. Let the milk sour (or scientifically, coagulating the casein protein). Then separate the curds (solids) from the whey (liquid). The curds are then salted and left to age.\nBacteria, enzymes or fungi may be added at various stages. These along with the type of milk, temperature, time and moisture are all controlled to produced the desired taste, color and texture. Herbs and spices may also be added.\nThe nutritional value of cheese varies depending on the variety. Cottage and mozzarella cheese are at the lower end of fat and calories per serving while mascarpone and cream cheese pack it on.\nFor cheese lovers who think one day is just not enough to celebrate cheese, National Day Calendar has you covered for the entire year. There are 18 other cheese specific holidays on the calendar from National Cheese Doodle Day (March 5) and National Grilled Cheese Sandwich Day (April 12) to Cheese Souffle Day (May 18), National Cheese Day (June 4) and Moldy Cheese Day (October 9).

National Cheesecake Day is July 30, and there are three other flavors on the calendar along with National Cream Cheese Brownie Day just around the corner on February 10.    \nBy celebrating National Goat Cheese Month in August, cheese lovers can celebrate 10 out of 12 months of the year.

In 1909, sixteen-year-old Ray Newby was a student under the supervision of Charles Doc Herrold at Herrold College of Engineering and Wireless. He played the first records over the airwaves before the word disc jockey even existed.\nWhat started as an experiment from the Garden City Bank Building where the college was located in San Fernando, California was soon being replicated by radio broadcasters across the country. Before Newbys broadcasts, news, music and entertainment were primarily broadcast live.\nIt wasnt until 25 years later that radio commentator Walter Winchell coined the term disc jockey.\nToday, contemporary DJs play music from vinyl to digital. Regardless of the medium they use, the term disc jockey still applies.\nHip hop DJs became popular in the late 70s and 80s using multiple turntables and using the turntables themselves as an instrument to alter the music.

National Peanut Butter Day is observed annually on January 24th.\n \nThe early peanut butter made by the Aztecs and Incas around 1000 BC was more of a paste and not nearly as creamy as the peanut butter we know now.\nPeanut butter didnt become widely used until the 20th century. First, the peanut had to be considered more than animal feed, which it was until the late 1800s. At the turn of the century, inventions that made planting, cultivating and harvesting the legume (the peanut isnt a nut at all) made it possible to see the peanut as a retail and wholesale food item. (See more by visiting National Peanut Day -September 13)\nPeanut butter is a good source of vitamin E, B6, niacin, calcium, potassium and iron, is packed with protein and is rich in healthy monounsaturated fat.\nWe can thank four men for the inventions and processes that bring us the creamy, smooth peanut butter we enjoy today: Marcus Gilmore Edson of Canada, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, Dr. Ambrose Straub of St. Louis, Missouri and chemist Joseph Rosefield.\nIn 1884, Edson developed a process to make peanut paste from milling roasted peanuts between two heated plates. The famous cereal maker and health food specialist of the time, Kellogg, patented a process with raw peanuts in 1895. Dr. Straub is responsible for patenting a peanut butter making machine in 1903.\nPeanut butter was introduced to audiences at the 1904 Universal Exposition in St. Louis at C.H. Sumners concession stand.\nBut the man who brought us the peanut butter we know and love today was Joseph Rosefield.  In 1922, through homogenization, Rosefield was able to keep peanut oil from separating from the peanut solids. He later sold the patent to a company that began making Peter Pan peanut butter. He went into business for himself selling Skippy peanut butter through Rosefield Packing.

Sheridan responded that it was Irish coffee.\nA travel writer, Stanton Delaplane, brought Irish coffee to the United States after having it at Shannon Airport.\nDelaplane brought the idea to the Buena Vista Cafe on November 10, 1952.

Chocolate cakes, as we think of them today, mostly did not exist then.  According to the Dover Post, the chocolate cake was born in 1765 when a doctor and a chocolate maker teamed up in an old mill.  They ground up cocoa beans between huge millstones to make a thick syrup. The liquid was poured into molds shaped like cakes, which were meant to be transformed into a beverage.  \nA popular Philadelphia cookbook author, Eliza Leslie, published the earliest chocolate cake recipe in 1847 in The Ladys Receipt Book.  Unlike chocolate cakes we know today, this recipe used chopped chocolate.  Other cooks of the time such as Sarah Tyson Rorer and Maria Parloa all made contributions to the development of the chocolate cake and were prolific authors of cookbooks.\nThe first boxed cake mix was created by a company called O.

The corn for a tortilla chip is soaked in a lime-water solution that breaks down the hulls. This creates a crisper, milder chip. A corn chip is sturdier with a richer corn flavor. Both were popular snacks originating in Mexico.\nThere are two men credited with patenting and marketing the corn chip in the United States. First, Isador J. Filler often ate a tostada (a hard corn tortilla with toppings) while traveling in San Antonio, Texas as a salesman. He struck on the idea of making them in rectangles and marketing them as a chip. In 1932 he patented his concept.\nAround the same time, Elmer Doolin was also traveling in San Antonio and was enjoying friotes. According to the story, he paid $100 for the recipe. Experimenting in his home until he created the ideal chip, Doolin then started selling them from the back of his Model T Ford. When he began mass producing them under the name of Frito Corn Chips, they were a hit.\nIn 1945, Doolin came to an agreement with Herman Lay (of potato chip fame) to distribute Doolins Fritos across the country. The two companies merged in 1959 after Doolins death.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nEnjoy some corn chips and use #NationalCornChipDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY  \nWithin our research, we have been unable to identify the creator of National Corn Chip Day.  \nThere are over 1,200 national days.

The name later carried over to those in business who, while known to be bankrupt, would continue to do business.\nIn politics a lame duck is a person currently holding a political office who has either:\n\nlost a re-election bid\nchose not to seek another term\nprevented from running for re-election due to a term limit\nthe office held has been eliminated\n\nPrior to the ratification of the 20th Amendment to the United States Constitution, there was for Congress a 13-month delay between election day and the day the newly elected officials took office. In the case of a lame duck, this was a 13 month notice his or her job was terminating crippling their influence. Hence the lame or injured duck.\nAn awful lot of people are confused as to just what is meant by a lame duck Congress. Its like where some fellows worked for you and their work wasnt satisfactory and you let em out, but after you fired em, you let em stay long enough so they could burn your house down.  - Will Rogers\nThe same applied to the president. The 20th Amendment changed the date the newly elected president took office from March 4th to January 20th.\nDuring a lame duck session, members of Congress are no longer accountable to their constituents. It is possible for their focus to switch to more personal gain instead of acting on behalf of their constituents with an eye toward re-election.\nThe 20th Amendment shortened this period from 13 months to 2 months.  While lame duck sessions still occur (20 such sessions have occurred since the amendment took effect in 1935), there is less time for sweeping legislation to be approved.  Even so, lame duck Congresses have declared war, impeached a president, censured a senator and passed the Homeland Security Act among other actions.\nIt is also considered a time when the peaceful transition of power occurs.  Preparations take place for the out-going president to leave office and the newly elected president to take office.\n\n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nIf you are a Lame Duck:   Reflect back on what you have learned, and on your successes and triumphs.\nIf you know a Lame Duck:  Say thank you, give recognition for their success and support for their future.\nIf you are not a Lame Duck or do not Know a Lame Duck:  Enjoy today in everything you do and share the information you learned about Lame Duck Day.\nUse #NationalLameDuckDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nFebruary 6th was chosen as National Lame Duck Day as this was the day in 1933 that the 20th Amendment was proclaimed by the U.S. Secretary of State.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

However, research has failed to find the creator of this day.\nA special update from the Grandson of the founder of Fettuccine Alfredo\nHistory of Alfredo Di Lelio, creator in 1908 of Fettuccine All Alfredo (Fettuccine Alfredo), now served by his nephew Ines Di Lelio, at the restaurant Il Vero Alfredo - Alfredo Di Roma in Rome, Piazza Augusto Imperatore 30\nWith reference of your article (for which I thank you), I have the pleasure to tell you the history of my grandfather Alfredo Di Lelio, who is the creator of Fettuccine allAlfredo (Fettuccine Alfredo) in 1908 in the trattoria run by his mother Angelina in Rome, Piazza Rosa (Piazza disappeared in 1910 following the construction of the Galleria Colonna / Sordi).\nThis trattoria of Piazza Rosa has become the birthplace of fettuccine allAlfredo. More specifically, as is well known to many people who love the fettuccine allAlfredo, this famous dish in the world was invented by Alfredo Di Lelio concerned about the lack of appetite of his wife Ines, who was pregnant with my father Armando (born February 26, 1908). Alfredo di Lelio opened his restaurant Alfredo in 1914 in Rome and in 1943, during the war, he sold the restaurant to others outside his family. In 1950 Alfredo Di Lelio decided to reopen with his son Armando his restaurant in Piazza Augusto Imperatore n.30 Il Vero Alfredo (Alfredo di Roma), whose fame in the world has been strengthened by his nephew Alfredo and that now managed by me, with the famous gold cutlery (fork and spoon gold) donated in 1927 by two well-known American actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks (in gratitude for the hospitality). See also the website of Il Vero Alfredo.(with news also about franchising). I celebrate every year (as this year) in my restaurant (founded by my grandfather Alfredo Di Lelio) the USA Holiday of. fettuccine allAlfredo (february 7). I must clarify that other restaurants Alfredo in Rome do not belong to the family tradition of Il Vero Alfredo - Alfredo di Roma. I inform you that the restaurant Il Vero Alfredo -Alfredo di Roma is in the registry of Historic Shops of Excellence of the City of Rome Capitale. \nBest regards Ines Di Lelio\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

Gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, mercury, sulfur and carbon were the earliest known elements. These were all known prior to the 1st century A.D.\nOver time, arsenic, antimony, phosphorus and zinc were discovered. By 1809 there were 47 discovered elements.\nOne of the earliest attempts to organize the elements was by Johann Dobereiner in 1817. He organized elements into groups of three, or triads, based on similar qualities.\nOn February 7, 1863, English chemist John Newlands published one of the first table of elements, which divided the known 56 elements into 11 groups based on the Law of Octaves. This suggested that any one element will have similar properties to elements eight places before and behind it on the table.\nArranging the elements according to increasing atomic weight, Newlands was one of the first scientists to detect a pattern to the properties of elements. As a result, his table left room for new discoveries, predicting future discovered elements would complete the table. Newlands correctly predicted the discovery of Germanium.\nWhile parts of Newlands periodic table had flaws, so did other later proposed tables. In 1869 chemist Dimitri Mendeleev published a paper developing a periodic table arranging the elements also based on atomic mass. By this time only 60 of the over 100 elements we know today were discovered.\nThere were also some inaccuracies attributed to some of those elements. While Mendeleev corrected some of these inaccuracies, he made assumptions about others causing elements to be placed incorrectly on the table. Like Newlands, Mendeleev predicted discoveries as well. He correctly predicted the properties of five elements and their compounds.\nThe discoveries through out Scot William Ramsays career from 1892 to 1910, along with John William Strutt, Morris Travers and Frederick Soddy led to the identification of the noble gasses. Ramsay was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1904 for discovering five elements.\nHenry Moseley, an experimental physicist, contributed to the development of the modern periodic table when he discovered in 1913 that each element has a specific number of protons. As a result, four new chemical elements were later found, though not during his lifetime.\nSince the early 20th century there have been very few significant changes to the periodic table. The 21st century is still young, though and some researchers have suggested new approaches to the periodic table while maintaining its integrity as one of the most valuable tools in the science of chemistry.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nVisit www.PeriodicTableDay.org for more information.\nUse #PeriodicTableDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nNational Periodic Table Day was founded on February 7, 2016, with the goal of promoting the challenges that were overcome to develop the modern periodic table.  Mr. David T. Steineker, author, inventor, and chemistry teacher at Jefferson County Public Schools in Kentucky is inspired by those challenges and took the initiative to celebrate National Periodic Table Day based upon John Newlands first table of the elements published on February 7, 1863.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

China is full of lore and histories of the origins of the kite. Many are related to the way wind affects the leaves on the trees, the shelters they lived in, blowing away the sails on their ships and the hats they wore upon their heads. The stories also tell of kites being invented to spy on their enemies or to send messages.\nThere is also evidence that the people of South Sea Islands were using kites for fishing around the same time as the people of China.\nEarly kites were constructed from bamboo or sturdy reeds for framing, leaves, silk or paper for the sail and vines or braided fibers for the line or tether. While they were initially used as tools, they were also ceremonial as well. Used to send messages into the heavens or to lift offerings up to the gods, kites had a symbolic place in the culture.\nToday kites are popular both as hobbies and for outdoor fun. They range from a simple diamond kite to more complicated box kites and giant sled kites. Stunt kites, also known as sport kites, are designed so the operator can maneuver the kite into dips, twists and dives with dramatic effect.\nTips for Getting Your Kite Up in the Air and Keeping it There\n\n\nBe sure the kite is assembled correctly.\n\n\nCheck the wind.  Some kites require more wind and others less. Picking the right day for your kite is key.  A light breeze (5-20 mph) is generally optimal.\n\n\nBe safe.  Dont fly the kite near power lines, trees or other sky high obstacles. Wide open spaces are best.\n\n\nBe safer.  Dont fly in the rain.\n\n\nWhen launching the kite, be sure to have your back to the wind.  If the wind is light, have a friend hold the kite down wind and hold your line taught, reeling in slowly until the kite launches.\n\n\nDont let the line out too quickly.  Let the line out at the same pace the kite is gaining altitude.\n\n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nGo outside and fly a kite if weather permits. If not, make one inside.  In some parts of the country, the time of year may make it difficult to fly a kite.  There are kite festivals at various periods of the year. Use today to scout out those festivals and make a plan to join in.

Brolly is a slang word for umbrella, often used in Britain, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.  Bumbershoot is a fanciful Americanism, for an umbrella, from the late 19th century.\nThe basic umbrella was invented over four thousand years ago.  There is evidence of umbrellas in the ancient art and artifacts of Egypt  Assyria, Greece and China.\nIt was the Chinese that first waterproofed umbrellas for use in the rain. They waxed and lacquered their paper parasols to protect them from rain.\nThe first of all umbrella shops were called James Smith and Sons.  The shop opened in 1830 and is still located at 53 New Oxford Street, London, England.\nIn 1928, Hans Haupts pocket umbrellas appeared.  In 1969, Bradford E.

They had been making the cakes since 1840, but in 1880, four of the sons formed the Kendal Mint Cake Company.\nIn the United States, as early as 1900, peppermint patties were made by regional confectioneries.

Possibly the most known, though not the oldest, York Peppermint Patties were made by the York Cone Company of Pennsylvania.\nYork Peppermint Patties were first made in 1940 and distributed regionally much like other candy makers of the era.  York dominated the market because of its firmness and crispness while the others were soft. A former York employee remembered that the final (sample) test of the patty before it left the factory was called a snap test.  If the candy did not break clean in the middle, it did not make it onto candy store shelves.\nIn 1975 the company was acquired by Peter Paul Cadbury.

This unofficial national holiday is held on this day to honor the birth of the inventor of the Ferris Wheel, George Washington Gale Ferris, Jr.\nPreparations for the 1893 Worlds Columbian Exposition began in earnest in 1891.  Director of works for the fair, Daniel H. Burnham, laid out the challenge: create a centerpiece to the show that will rival the Eiffel Tower in Paris.\nErected the year before, the Eiffel Tower was quickly becoming a world attraction.  Ideas were tossed about, plans presented and plans rejected.\nGeorge Washington Gale Ferris was inspired.  He contemplated several ideas, but it wasnt until one evening in a Chicago chophouse that he struck on an idea that could fit the challenge.  After sketching out the design on napkins, he proceeded to develop his plans.\nWhen presented with the concept Burnham balked, doubting it could safely carry people to such heights.  Ferris persisted.  Spending $25,000 of his own money, he paid for safety studies, obtained $600,000 more from investors, hired engineers and built the 250-foot diameter wheel and hoisted it up between 140-foot twin towers.\nIt was a colossal success at 26 stories tall and making a whopping $726,805.50.  In 1893, that was a hefty profit for the fair.\nDespite the wheels success, Ferris struggled after the fair.  Lawsuits over who owed who bankrupt him.  His wife left him.  Then in 1896, a few short years after the fair, he died at the age of 37 of typhoid fever.\nThe original wheel suffered a similar fate.  In 1906, it was destroyed with dynamite for scrap metal.  The idea has lived on, and wheels continue to be enjoyed around the world.\nWHEELS AROUND THE WORLD\nTianjin Eye Ferris Wheel in Tianjin, China, is built over a bridge spanning the Hai River.\nThe London Eye overlooks the Thames River in London.\nThe ever classic Wonder Wheel of Coney Island in New York City was built by the Eccentric Ferris Wheel Company from 1918-1920.\nTake your breath away looking over Niagara Falls from a seat on the Niagara Skywheel in Canada.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nIf you are near a Ferris Wheel, catch a lift up to the top and enjoy the view.

Observed each year on February 18th, this is a day to appreciate the convenience batteries provide to our everyday lives.  \nToday we would be hard pressed to find someone in the United States who doesnt derive a benefit from a battery.  Even those who live off the grid have battery operated devices such as a flashlight, radio or watch.\nA battery is used to change chemical energy into electricity by bringing the different chemicals together in a certain order.  When correctly ordered the electrons will travel from one chemical to another creating an electrical current.\nWhile manufacturing of batteries for everyday personal use has only developed in the last 50-60 years, archaeologists have found evidence of a device that may have been used to electroplate gold onto silver, much like a battery would.\nIn 1936, during the construction of a new railway near Baghdad, a Parthian tomb was found.  Archaeologist Wilhelm Konig found a clay jar containing a copper cylinder encasing an iron rod. Konig suggested the find to be approximately 2,000 years old.\nIn 1748, Benjamin Franklin first coined the term battery to describe an array of charged glass plates.\nIn 1800 French scientist Alessandro Volta layered silver, cloth or paper soaked in salt or acid and zinc into what he called voltaic piles, which generated a limited electrical current.  He published his work, and we get the word volt from his name to describe electric potential.\nIt was William Cruickshank, an English chemist, who first designed a battery for mass production in 1802.\nWe can credit chemist John Daniell with developing a way to reduce corrosion when batteries arent being used. In 1820 he invented the Daniell Cell, which incorporated mercury, reducing the corrosion.\nGradual improvements were made by various scientists and inventors over time until in 1896 when the National Carbon Company (later known as the Eveready Battery Company) manufactured the first commercially available battery called the Columbia.  Two years later, National Carbon Company introduced the first D sized battery for the first flashlight.\nThe first battery operated watch was produced in 1957 by the Hamilton Watch Company.\nToday batteries are available for countless purposes.  In our modern age, portable electricity isnt something we think about every day because it is so easily accessible.  We charge the batteries on our phones by using the batteries in our cars as we travel down the road.  We even have portable chargers that can charge our batteries where ever we are.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nTo celebrate National Battery Day, it is a good idea to check all of your smoke alarm batteries!

This holiday has been set aside for all the chocolate mint lovers to eat their favorite treats all day long.\nThe Aztecs and Mayans are given much credit for their ways with chocolate, and while chocolate was brought back to Europeans, they were not fond of the dark, bitter bean, and it was used more for medicinal purposes.\nAs it was mostly consumed as a hot beverage, Europeans mixed mint, cinnamon and other spices to make it more palatable.  Over time, sugar was added, and the combination of chocolate and mint became fashionable.\nFast forward to the mid-1800s when inventions and improvements in processes made it possible for confectioners to begin mass producing chocolates.  Even then, small candy shops served a local public.  Advertisements for mint chocolates, or chocolate mints, did not start showing up in newspapers until the turn of the century.\nThe International Dairy Foods Association states that mint chocolate chip is the 10th most popular flavor of ice cream.\nOne of the earliest mass-producers of chocolate mints was Huylers in New York, which had a chain of stores across the country.\nToday we find mint chocolate in everything from ice cream to brownies, cookies and candies, liquors and sauces.\nGirl Scout Thin Mint cookies were first sold in 1953 and are still their most popular cookie.\nMint chocolate is also the name of an herb with edible leaves that taste like chocolate and mint.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nBelow is a favorite frosting recipe for chocolate cake.

In Mexico, when drinking straight tequila (especially if the quality was bad), the best course of action was to down it in one swallow, suck on a wedge of lime and lick a dash of salt off the back of your hand.\nIt makes sense that the salt followed the lime and the tequila to the margarita glass. Today, lime is not the only flavor of margarita, and the specialists behind the bar have gotten creative mixing dried herbs, infused sugars and exotic salts to enhance both the presentation of the glass and the flavor of the cocktail. \nMargaritas can be served on the rocks (shaken with ice), frozen (blended with ice), or straight up (without ice).\nThere are many different stories and myths, beginning as early as 1938, as to how and when the margarita was created.\nIn the December 1953 issue of Esquire magazine, the margarita cocktail was the Drink of the Month.  The recipe as printed was:\n\n1 ounce tequila\nDash of Triple Sec\nJuice of 1/2 lime or lemon\n\nPour over crushed ice, stir.  Rub the rim of a stem glass with rind of lemon or lime, spin in salt pour, and sip.  (Wikipedia)\nThe margarita was further popularized with the 1977 release of Jimmy Buffetts song Margaritaville.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nGet a margarita and use #NationalMargaritaDay to post on social media.

Around the world, tile plays a variety of roles. From the modest to the sublime, tile proves to be versatile and attractive.\nHistorically, only the wealthy could afford tile in their homes. The expense of handmade or small batch production meant tiles were difficult for the ordinary person to obtain. With the advent of the industrial revolution, tile not only became more affordable but the designs and features expanded with the technology.\nBeautiful tile finds its way into every room of the home, outdoor spaces, commercial and industrial buildings by providing an infinite number of styles through color, texture and dimension.  The durability and energy efficiency of tile adds value, and no material is more sustainable or has lower maintenance costs.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nTake time to appreciate the quality craftsmanship of the tile work around you. If a remodel or building is in your future, consider tile in your design. Share an image of why you choose tile with #WhyTile, #Coverings2017, #NationalTileDay on Instagram and Twitter.\nHISTORY\nCoverings, the largest international tile & stone show in North America, founded National Tile Day in 2017 to shine a spotlight on the benefit of tile in residential and commercial design.

There are some recipes where banana bread is made with yeast when it is then usually sliced, toasted and spread with butter.\nIt was with the popularization of baking soda and baking powder in the 1930s that banana bread first became a standard feature of American cookbooks and appeared in Pillsburys 1933 Balanced Recipes cookbook. Banana bread later gained further acceptance with the release of the original Chiquita Bananas Recipe Book in 1950. \nThe United States saw the arrival of bananas in the 1870 s, but it took a while before they appeared as an ingredient in desserts.\nThe Vienna Model Bakery advertised banana bread as something new in the April 21, 1893, edition of St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  An early restaurant/bakery chain owned by Gaff, Fleischmann & Company, The Viena Model Bakery was known for their baked goods and was likely one of the first to produce banana bread in the United States.  The recipe was made with banana flour, which is made by drying strips of the fruit, then grinding it to a powder.  This process had long been used in the West Indies.\nIn Hawaii during World War I, there was a surplus of bananas due to very few ships to export the fruit.  In order not to waste the fruits, alternative uses for bananas were developed.  The bakeries started incorporating the fruit into their bread.\nThis recipe was printed in The Maui News on April 12, 1918, for banana bread:\n2/3 banana\n 1/3 flour\n Yeast, coconut milk or water\nThere was also rationing of staple food items such as flour.  Banana flour was a suggested substitute.  It was touted as a health food and recommended for a vegetarian diet.\nThis, of course, is not the quick bread we know today.  A recipe submitted by Mrs. Dean in the February 18, 1918, issue of The Garden Island paper for a banana muffin might more closely resemble the quick bread we think of today.\n1 cup corn meal\n 3-1/2 teaspoons of baking powder\n 2 tablespoons of sugar\n 1 sifted banana\n 3/4 cup rye flour\n 1 teaspoon salt\n 3/4 cup milk\n 1 egg\n 1 tablespoon Crisco\nMix dry ingredients, add banana, milk and egg and Crisco.\nThe difference between a quick bread and a muffin in baking has a lot to do with the type of fat and how it is mixed creating a different crumb or texture to the bread.\nIn 1927, Unifruit (a wholesale produce company) offered a free cookbook called From the Tropics to Your Table full of banana recipes including banana muffins and breads.  This little cookbook would have been handy during the Great Depression which was just around the corner. Throwing out overripe bananas was not something a family could afford to do.  Utilizing every bit of food and stretching meals was a daily practice.  Over ripe bananas, as well as other fruits and vegetables, were baked into breads, stews and other dishes when flavor and texture were not as appealing raw.\nThere are many different variations of the traditional banana bread, a few of which include Banana raisin bread - Banana nut bread - Chocolate chip banana bread.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nTo participate in National Banana Bread Day, try one of the following banana bread recipes:\nButtermilk Banana Bread\nBanana Sour Cream Bread\nApplesauce Banana Bread\nBanana Chocolate Chip Bread\nPeanut Butter Chocolate Chip Banana Bread\nUse #NationalBananaBreadDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nWithin our research, we were unable to identify the creator of National Banana Bread Day.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

Tortilla chips are made from corn tortillas that have been cut into wedges and then fried.  The corn tortillas are made from corn, vegetable oil, salt and water.  Typically made with yellow corn, tortillas can also be made with white, blue or red corn.\nEven though tortilla chips have always been considered to be a Mexican food, known as tostados, they were first mass-produced in Los Angeles in the late 1940s. It is said that the triangle-shaped tortilla chips were made popular by Rebecca Webb Carranza as a way to use the misshapen tortillas that were rejected from the automated tortilla manufacturing machine that she and her husband used at their Los Angeles deli and tortilla factory. \nCarranza realized that once the discarded tortillas were cut into triangle shapes and fried, they became a popular snack.  She then sold them for a dime a bag at the El Zarape Tortilla Factory.  Carranza received the Golden Tortilla Award in 1994 for her contribution to the Mexican food industry.\nThe United States is one of the primary markets for tortilla chips. \nAnother favorite dish made with tortilla chips is nachos.  The dish was first created around 1943 by Ignacio Nacho Anaya. Nachos are tortilla chips served with melted or shredded cheese, and often additional toppings are added, such as meat, salsa, refried beans, tomatoes, diced onion, lettuce, olives, jalapenos, guacamole and sour cream.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nGo and get your favorite dip and enjoy some tortilla chips.

It is a day for the delicious crunchy nut to be enjoyed once it has been covered in chocolate.  The possibilities are endless as there are so many different types of nuts, as well as different types of chocolate.\nFor thousands of years, nuts have been a staple of the human diet.  The walnut was a favorite of the ancient Greeks and Romans, while the pecans were a favorite of the Native Americans.\nBoth chocolate and nuts can be good for you.\nDark chocolate seems to possess a substantial amount of antioxidants, while the nuts contain the essential fatty acids and linolenic acids.  The fats in nuts, for the most part, are unsaturated fats, including monounsaturated fats.  Nuts also provide arginine, a substance that may help make the walls of the arteries more flexible and less prone to blockage from blood clot formation.  Many nuts are good sources of vitamins E and B2 and are rich in protein, folate, fiber and essential minerals, such as magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, copper and selenium.\nThe first chocolate covered peanut candy were Goobers which were originally sold in 1925.  The word Goober was a common slang word for peanut. \nOne of the more recognized chocolate covered nuts is the M & M. These chocolate covered peanuts or chocolate covered almonds have become a favorite of many.  The peanut M & M was introduced in 1954.  They were tan until 1960 when the colors red, yellow and green were added to production.\n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nWhether it be unsweetened chocolate, sweet chocolate, semisweet chocolate, white chocolate or dark chocolate mixed with peanuts, cashews, almonds, macadamias, pecans, or any other nut, enjoy your favorite combination!!

For those who do not eat pistachios, buy some and give them to someone who does.  Crack them open and eat them up or enjoy them in ice cream or your favorite pistachio dessert!\nPistachios arrived in the United States sometime in the 1880s, but they have been cultivated in the Middle East since Biblical times.\nThe pistachio tree grows to about 20 feet tall needing little or no rain and must have high heat.  In Iran, they claim they have pistachio trees still living that are 700 years old!  A new tree takes between 7 and 10 years to mature and bear fruit.\nPistachio Facts:\n\n All pistachio shells are naturally beige in color.  Some companies dye nuts red or green if nuts are inferior or for consumer demand.\nCalifornia produces about 300 million pounds of pistachios each year, accounting for 98 percent of Americas production.\nPistachio shells typically split naturally when ripe.\nThe kernels are often eaten whole, either fresh or roasted and either salted or unsalted.\nIn the Middle East, people call the pistachio the smiling nut.\nIn China, people call the pistachio the happy nut.\n\nHealth Benefits\nPistachios are an excellent source of vitamin B6, copper and manganese and a good source of protein, fiber, thiamine and phosphorus.  Scientific evidence suggests but does not prove that eating 1.5 ounces (42.5g) per day of most nuts, such as pistachios, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease.  US Food and Drug Administration, July 2003\nA Great Thing To Do   Recycle the Pistachio Shells!\nThe empty pistachio shells are useful for recycling in several ways.  If unsalted, the shells need not be washed and dried before reuse, but washing is simple if that is not the case.  Practical uses include as a fire starter; kindling to be used with crumpled paper; to line the bottom of pots containing houseplants for drainage and retention of soil for up to two years; as a mulch for shrubs and plants that require acid soils, as a medium for orchids; and as an addition to a compost pile designed for wood items that take longer to decompose than leafy materials (it can take up to a year for pistachio shells to decompose unless soil is added to the mix).  Shells from salted pistachios can also be placed around the base of plants to deter slugs and snails.  Many craft uses for the shells include holiday tree ornaments, jewelry, mosaics and rattles.  Research indicates that pistachio shells may be helpful in cleaning up pollution created by mercury emissions. \n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nHave a pistachio.

Its National Fairy Tale Day.\nWhat were once oral histories, myths and legends retold around the fire or by traveling storytellers, have been written down and become known the world over as fairy tales.\nThe origins of most fairy tales were unseemly and would not be approved or rated as appropriate for children by the Association of Fairy Tales by todays standards. Most were told as a way to make children behave, teach a lesson or to pass the time much like ghost stories around a campfire today.\nMany of the stories have some basis in truth. For example, some believe the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is inspired by the real life of Margarete von Waldeck, the daughter of the 16th century Count of Waldeck. The area of Germany where the family lived was known for mining. Some of the tunnels were so tight they had to use children - or small people such as dwarfs - to work the mines.\nMargaretes beauty is well documented, and she had a stepmother who sent her away. She fell in love with a prince but mysteriously died before she could have her happily ever after.\nAs the stories evolved, they took on a more magical quality with fictional characters such as fairies, giants, mermaids and gnomes, and sometimes gruesome story plots.\nToes cut off to fit into a slipper, a wooden boy killing his cricket or instead of kissing that frog prince his head must be cut off, but those are the unrated versions.\nThe brothers Grimm collected and published some of the more well-known tales we are familiar with today. Jakob and his brother Wilhelm together set out on a quest to preserve these tales at a time in history when a tradition of oral storytelling was fading. In 1812, they published their first volume of stories titled Household Tales.  Their stories had a darker quality and were clearly meant for an adult audience.\nRumpelstiltskin is one of the tales they collected. There were several versions, and the little man went by many names in different parts of Europe. From Trit-a-trot in Ireland to Whuppity Stoorie in Scotland, Rumplestiltskin was one difficult man to identify.\nInterestingly, Professor Rumplestiltskin Schwartz has been known to debate the origins of some Mother Goose stories, including the fabled Three Little Pigs. The tale is full of Jewish allegory and symbolism. Based on this and much more, Schwartz would place the origins of these particular set of piggies in 14th century Gdansk.

Where Grimms tales could take on a darker cast and were unmistakably written with adults in mind, Andersens stories are sweet and warm.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nHow to Tell a Great Story:\n\nEngage your audience. Children like to participate. Have them quack every time the Ugly Duckling is mentioned, or make the motions of climbing Jacks beanstalk.\nUse repetition. This will also keep the kids engaged. It not only helps them to remember the story but sets them up for the next round of the repeated phrase or stanza.\nGive your characters a voice. Nobody likes a monotone story teller. Buehler, Buehler, Buehler. No, not even children like the monotone. Varying your voice for each character and inflecting excitement, sadness and disappointment will create drama and stimulate the imaginations of the little minds listening to you.\nAsk questions as you go. Its a good way to keep your story flowing and to gauge the childrens listening skills.\nFind out if someone has a story of their own. You might be in the presence of a great story teller!\n\nShare your favorite fairy tale with friends and family.  Try relating them from memory as this has long been a tradition.

However, it may not be a good idea to take that nap at your desk during work!\nThere are different types of naps. The Power Nap is approximately 10 to 20 minutes long and can give a boost of energy to get us through the rest of the day. It also doesnt leave us drowsy like some longer naps might and will also allow us to fall asleep at a decent time at night.\nThe Hangover is about 30 minutes long, 10 too many, leaving us loopy and wanting just to stay asleep. We will snap out of it and feel much like we had a Power Nap, but it may take a bit of effort before we feel those benefits.\nThe Brainiac lasts about 60 minutes and includes the deepest sleep. While we may feel a little grogginess upon waking, much like the Hangover, our ability to recall facts, names and faces, will be improved. This type of nap may be the best nap after a round of studying or before a big test.\nThe California King lasts about 90 minutes and is typically a full cycle of sleep. It will also include REM or a dream stage. This nap avoids the hangover like the power nap does and improves creative thinking and motor memory, but night time sleep may become elusive.\nGood husbands have been keen on these benefits long since the invention of the shopping mall. They are not strangers to public sleeping or the power nap. It may be something the modern non-napping woman should consider.\nSome employers have begun to recognize the value of a nap.

Its National Tooth Fairy Day.  \nLike some of the fantastic creations who oversee children, the tooth fairy is a relative newcomer to the world of child fantasies.\nIn the mid-1920s fairies were used for all sorts of health education from bath fairies to fresh air fairies as a way to get kids to remember to eat their vegetables, wash behind their ears and get a good nights rest. Like toothpaste today that advertises fruity flavors and sparkles to get kids excited to brush their teeth, in 1925 it was probably quite a bit more difficult considering the pastes were mostly peroxide and baking soda. One advertisement was for a Fairy Wand Tooth Whitener. This product promised to brush away cigarette and coffee stains.  The ad was aimed at both children and adults, we hope!\nThen in 1927, Esther Watkins Arnold printed an eight-page playlet for children called The Tooth Fairy. It was the same year Sir Arthur Conan Doyle proved his claim that fairies and gnomes are real and verified with pictures of two little girls surrounded by fairies. The world was ripe with imagination and primed to have a tooth fairy about to come collect the lost teeth of little boys and girls and leave a coin or two behind.\nArnolds play began to be performed in schools the following year, and the tooth fairy has been slipping into homes ever since.  She (or he) started leaving nickels and dimes under the pillows of sleeping children. Over the years there have been variations on the theme.  In 1942, in an article written by columnist Bob Balfe in the Palm Beach Post, his children received War Stamps to put in their books when they lost a tooth.  It was a popular alternative during a time when giving to the war effort was a motivating factor.  Today, the tooth fairy jingles much less than ever.

It is made up of whole or pieces of fruit (a mixture) in sugar syrup.  The whole fruits are cooked in water in which sugar and spices have been added.  The seasonings which may be added to the syrup are vanilla, lemon peel, orange peel, cinnamon sticks, cinnamon powder, cloves, ground almonds, grated coconut, candied fruit or raisins.  Fruit compote may be served either warm or cold.\nThe French belief that fruit cooked in sugar syrup balanced the effects of humidity on the body led to the invention of compotes.  It was originally served in the afternoon, as a snack with sour cream and biscuits.  It was during the Renaissance that it was served chilled at the end of dinner.\nBecause of its easy preparation and the fact that it was made from inexpensive ingredients and contained no dairy products, compote became a staple of Jewish households throughout Europe and was considered part of Jewish cuisine. \nFruit compote is often topped with whipped cream, cinnamon or vanilla sugar.  It is also sometimes prepared using dried fruits that have been soaked in water in which alcohol can be added, for example kirsch, rum or Frontignan.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nTry one of the following recipes:\nContest-Winning Hot Fruit Compote\nFruit Compote\nChef Lee Anne Wongs Pancakes with Summer Berry Compote\nAnne Burrells Angel Food Cake with Tropical Fruit Compote\nUse #NationalFruitCompoteDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nWithin our research, we were unable to identify the creator of National Fruit Compote Day.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

They are a household pet to some that can be trained and taught tricks.\nIn Dublin in 1772, a trained swine called the Learned Pig told time, counted and other such tricks to entertain crowds in the streets. \nThere was a famous, if fictitious, Learned Pig in London in the late 1700s which seemed to gain his learnedness from his mother eating an entire volume of Sir Robert Filmers manuscripts and Saobeverels Sermons before she delivered him into the world.

On National Anthem Day commemorates the day our nation adopted The Star Spangled Banner as our National Anthem.\nThe story behind The Star Spangled Banner is as moving as the anthem itself. While an attorney, Key was serving in the Georgetown Light Field Artillery during the War of 1812. In 1814 his negotiation skills as a lawyer were called upon to release Dr. William Beane who was a prisoner on the British naval ship, Tonnant. Early in September Key traveled to Baltimore in the company of Colonel John Skinner to begin negotiations.\nKey and Skinner secured Beanes release but since the British navy had begun attacking Baltimore, the trio had to wait at sea to return to Georgetown.\nFort McHenry is built on a peninsula of the Patapsco River, and the city of Baltimore is just across the Northwest Branch. In 1814, the population of Baltimore was roughly 50,000 people, hardly the metropolis it is today. The country itself was still young, and often families of soldiers lived nearby and provided support to their soldiers.\nThe British navy abandoned Baltimore and turned their full attention on Fort McHenry on September 13. As the 190-pound shells began to shake the fort, mother nature brought a storm of her own. Thunder and rain pelted the shore along with the bombs and shells. Throughout the night, parents, wives and children in their homes could hear and feel the bomb blasts across the way. There were reports of the explosions being felt as far away as Philadelphia. It was a long night of fear, worry and providing comfort to one another.\nAt sea, Key had a similar night. Being a religious man, one who believed the war could have been avoided, he watched the bombs bursting in air over the water and steadily pummeling Fort McHenry. It was surely a sight to behold.\nFor 25 hours the star-shaped fort manned by approximately 1,000 American soldiers endured over 1,500 cannon shots. The Fort answered with their own with almost no effect.\nIn the early morning of September 14th, after Major George Armisteads armed troops stopped the British landing party in a blaze of gunfire, he ordered the oversized American flag which had been made a few months before by Mary Perckersgill and her daughter, raised in all its glory over Fort McHenry, replacing the storm flag which had been raised during battle.\nAs Key waited at sea for dawn to break and smoke to clear, imagine the inspiring sight in the silence of the morning to see his countrys flag fully unfurled against the breaking of the day and the fort standing firm. \nKey was so moved by the experience he immediately began penning the lyrics to a song which were later published by his brother-in-law as a poem titled Defence of Fort MHenry.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nSing the Star Spangled Banner.  Did you know there are three more verses to the original song? As a challenge, try learning them all. Use #NationalAnthemDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nNearly 117 years passed after Key penned Defence of Fort MHenry before it became the national anthem of the United States of America.  Hail Columbia and My Country and Tis of Thee held honorary places as patriotic songs, but the United States didnt have an officially declared anthem until a congressional resolution, signed by President Herbert Hoover, when The Star Spangled Banner officially became the national anthem of the United States of America on March 3rd, 1931.\n*Historical note: The spelling of defence in the original title of Keys song is correct for the period.  \n\n\n\n\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

Its simply a way to show your support. With either a pat on the back or hearty handshake, be sure to give both past and present G.I.s your appreciation. While G.I.s refer to Army personnel, the day encompasses all those who have served in the military.  So, hug those Jarheads, Wingnuts, Squids and Coasties, too!\nToday the term G.I. is fairly commonly known to refer to those serving in the Armed Forces of the United States of America. How that came to be is a little less military protocol and more the American story.\nIt seems at the turn of the 20th century, G.I. was a notation used in supply records for galvanized iron. It was later used during World War I for German artillery shells made from galvanized iron.\nSometime during the war soldiers started interpreting the initials as Government Issue or General Issue. By the time World War II came around it was starting to gain meaning as the generic enlisted man.\nNot surprisingly, sarcastic usage among many servicemen was common, feeling they were just like any other Government Issued supply being mass-produced for Uncle Sam.\nAbout that time G.I. Joe was born. His creator, comic strip artist and former Army Sergeant David Breger, issued his first G.I. Joe cartoon series in Yank magazine on June 17, 1942.\nThe term G.I. became more permanently etched in the American language when in 1944 President Franklin Roosevelt signed the bill that became known as the G.I. Bill; Servicemens Readjustment Act.\nAnd then there was no going back when Hasbro trademarked their G.I. Joe as an action figure in 1964.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nFind a G.I. you know and give them a hug.

This day is for those who are 21 years or older to celebrate a drink called absinthe. \nOften mistaken for a liquor, it is truly a spirit because it isnt sweetened. It belongs with the vodkas, gins and whiskeys when categorizing absinthe.\nThe spirit is made by infusing wormwood, fennel, anise and other herbs into alcohol through distillation. The creation of absinthe is credited to Pierre Ordinaire, a French doctor. He developed and prescribed the elixir in the early 19th century as a cure for many illnesses.\nIt has a strong licorice flavor to it and has a high alcohol content. It is often served with ice, a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon over the glass and water poured over the sugar.\nAlso known as The Green Fairy, The Green Goddess or The Green Lady, the drink was popular with artists and writers. It was rumored to have hallucinogenic effects. Just as it was gaining in popularity, as the century was coming to a close, its reputation took some severe blows.\nThe Green Lady was blamed for causing madness, seizures and low morality, among other ills of society. One of the final blows was a scandal in 1905 involving a French laborer who had spent the day drinking. His drink of choice was absinthe. He later murdered his children and pregnant wife.\nThe drink was banned in France and other countries soon followed. In the United States and around the world the ban has since been lifted.\nStudies have proven there is nothing hallucinogenic about the drink. Absinthe does have a higher alcohol content than other spirits, so keeping that in mind is important to drink responsibly.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nHave some absinthe (Remember always to drink responsibly and never to drink and drive) and use #NationalAbsintheDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nWhy March 5th?

We would often rather be someplace else than sitting in a dental chair.  The dentist is not the person most of us look forward to seeing.  However, when our checkup is done, our teeth are cleaned, the cavities are filled, the broken tooth is fixed, or a toothache is gone, we appreciate what the dentist has done for us.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nIf you are not already in the habit of using them, this would be a great day to make a commitment to better dental habits.

Birdseye discovered the key was freezing the food quickly. Flash freezing forms small ice crystals which prevent the cell walls from bursting. Large ice crystals turn the food to mush.\nBirdseye applied for a multitude of patents, but one of his earliest is from 1927 for a process to flash freeze foods. Consider that in 1930 only 8 percent of American households had refrigeration units in their homes. A frozen food patent in 1927 was a visionary step in a long chain of events to make frozen foods a marketable product.\nIn 1930, the Birdseye label, owned by the General Food Corporation, began selling 26 products to 18 retails stores in and around Springfield, Massachusetts. Clarence Birdseye continued his work with General Foods Corporation.\nBirdseye died October 7, 1956, but the name and products he inspired continue today.\nFrozen dinners, first known as TV dinners, came on the scene in 1954 and were introduced by Swanson. These pre-cooked meals only needed to be heated through in the oven to be ready to eat.  No cooking skills were required. Pre-heat the oven, cook for the required length of time and eat.\nThe invention of the microwave has also changed the types of frozen foods and just how convenient these items can be.  Over the years, frozen foods have developed to meet consumer demand. A variety of family sized meals, health conscience meals and even organic meals have hit the markets in recent years.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nTake a trip to your local grocery store and find one of your favorites in the frozen food aisle!! Use #NationalFrozenFoodDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nProclamation 5157 was signed by President Ronald Reagan in which it said:  Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 6, 1984, as Frozen Food Day, and I call upon the American people to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

Since the end of the 19th century, cereal has become Americas most popular breakfast food.\nDo you remember mornings eating a bowl of cereal, reading the back of the box and trying to find the toy inside the box?\nNow, not only is cereal eaten for breakfast, it has become a popular bedtime snack, and some people even have a bowl for an evening meal.  Cereal is also used in many cake, cookie and bar recipes. The most popular one is Rice Crispy Bar Treats.\nA Little Cereal History:\n**  Ferdinand Schumacher, a German immigrant, began the cereal revolution in 1854 with a hand oats grinder in the back room of a small store in Akron, Ohio. His German Mills American Oatmeal Company was the nations first commercial oatmeal manufacturer.  In 1877, Schumacher adopted the Quaker symbol, the first registered trademark for a breakfast cereal.\n**  Granula, the first breakfast cereal, was invented in the United States in 1863 by James Caleb Jackson, operator of Our Home on the Hillside, which was later replaced by the Jackson Sanatorium in Dansville, New York.  The cereal never became popular since it was inconvenient as the heavy bran nuggets needed soaking overnight before they were tender enough to eat.\n**  The cereal industry rose from a combination of sincere religious beliefs and commercial interest in health foods.  Dr. John Harvey Kellogg experimented with granola.  He boiled some wheat, rolled it into thin films, and baked the resulting flakes in the oven; he acquired a patent in 1891.  In 1895 he launched Cornflakes, which overnight captured a national market.\n**  In 1906, Dr. John Harvey Kelloggs  brother, William K. Kellogg, after working for John, broke away, bought the corn flakes rights from his brother and set up the Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Company.  His signature on every package became the company trademark and insurance of quality.\n**  Charles W. Post introduced Grape-nuts in 1898 and soon followed with Post Toasties.\n**  Because of Kellogg and Post, the city of Battle Creek, Michigan is nicknamed the Cereal Capital of the World.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nHave a bowl of your favorite cereal for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

First, a method had to be invented for the cocoa bean to be processed and transformed into what we know as chocolate.  That process wasnt widely used until about the late 1890s and just about the same time the second extraordinary thing happened; agriculture found a way to grow the peanut and bring it to the public with steal tools and steam power.  \nIt didnt take long for confectioneries to add the now readily available peanuts to melted chocolate.

Popovers are airy rolls that puff up when baked, popping over the edge of the tin.  They are light and crispy on the outside while the insides are warm and often hollow.  They can be filled with custards, creams and fruits for a sweet treat, especially blueberries.   \nPopovers are similar to Yorkshire pudding and can also be served with savory combinations.\nMost popover recipes are made using mostly eggs, milk, flour and salt.  When making popovers, using eggs and milk that are at room temperature produces the best result. The resulting batter is thin but has enough air it that when it bakes the steam expands the batter, causing it to puff up and pop over the tin.  The egg proteins help the pastry hold its shape and eventually the crust turns flaky and golden.\n** 1850 - The oldest known reference to popovers in a letter of E.E. Stuart.\n** 1876 - The first cookbook with a popover recipe was Practical Cooking by M.N.

National Johnny Appleseed Day celebrates a kindly legend who lived by sage teachings and labored to bring the shade of fruit trees across much of the United States.\nIn Fort Wayne, Indiana in Johnny Appleseed Park there is a grave marking the spot where the legendary sower of apple seeds rests.\nHe was born John Chapman on September 26, 1774, in Leominster, Massachusetts to Nathaniel and Elizabeth Simons Chapman. Not much is known about his early life other than his mother died when he was two. His father packed up Johnny and his sister (an infant brother had died the previous year) and moved to Springfield, Massachusetts. His father served as a Minuteman and fought at Bunker Hill.\nThen in 1797, Chapman shows up in northwestern Pennsylvania propagating his apple seeds and working his way steadily into the frontier of West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and eventually as far west as Illinois and Iowa and as far north as Michigan and Wisconsin.\nIn his wake, he left orchards and the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, a Swedish spiritual leader whose books he would buy with whatever payment he might receive for his endeavors. In turn, Johnny would give the books away as he traveled and planted.\nMostly, though, he planted his seeds and seedlings for free along with his wisdom, his broad-brimmed pasteboard hat keeping the sun from his eyes as he went. Often shoeless, he traveled mostly by foot and sometimes by horseback or canoe. His appearance was nearly as noteworthy as his accomplishments, but so was his kindness. There was always a place at the table if Johnny Appleseed were to come visiting.\nThere are many stories told that the man would travel many miles to nurse an ailing orchard when word would reach him of its poor condition. Bringing the trees back to health would be his chief endeavor while dispersing wisdom, care and kindness as he did.\nAcross the Midwest, landmarks pepper the countryside honoring the man that brought fruit to the frontier. Warren County, Pennsylvania lays claim to Johnny Appleseeds first tree nursery.\nMansfield, Ohio honors the man with a monument in South Park.  The last known Chapman tree still lives! In rural Ashland County, Ohio, the tree struggles to survive but half of it still manages to bloom in the spring. \nIn his hometown of Springfield, Massachusetts there is an entire park named after the man who nurtured the land and made apple trees bloom across a young nation.\nJohnny Appleseed Day is celebrated on either March 11 or September 26. The September date is Appleseeds acknowledged birth date. The March date is sometimes preferred due to the planting season. While there is some vagueness concerning Appleseeds death and burial, it is known he became ill in early March and passed soon after.\n\nNational Johnny Appleseed Day is celebrated in many elementary schools across the country.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nEnjoy an apple and use #JohnnyAppleseedDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY \nWithin our research, we were unable to identify the creator of National Johnny Appleseed Day.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

On National Potato Chip Day, this snack will be enjoyed by millions of people across the country.\nFollowing is a little history about how the popular potato chip came to be.\nOn August 24, 1853, an unhappy restaurant customer, complaining that his potatoes were too thick and soggy, kept sending them back.  Chef George Crum decided to slice the potatoes as thin as possible, frying them until crisp and added extra salt.  To the chefs surprise, the customer loved them, and they soon became a regular item on the restaurants menu under the name of Saratoga Chips.\nAlternative explanations of the beginning of potato chips date them to recipes in Shilling Cookery for the People by Alexis Soyer (1845) or Mary Randolphs The Virginia House-Wife (1824).  There are many references between these dates to sliced potatoes being fried in grease but whether they were fried to a crisp is not clear.  \nWhat is clear is that by the late 1870s, the term Saratoga Chips was being widely used as a standard menu item on train cars, hotel restaurants and street carts.  The name carried on into grocers when the chips were made in larger batches by bakeries.  They shipped them by wagon to the restaurants and groceries by the barrel, and the groceries would then sell to private families by the pound.  Folks were instructed to bake the chips in a hot oven for a few minutes, and they would be as crisp as if fried that same day.  \nThe Dayton, Ohio-based Mike-sells Potato Chip Company, founded in 1910, calls itself the oldest potato chip company in the United States.  New England-based Tri-Sum Potato Chips, originally established in 1908 as the Leominster Potato Chip Company, in Leominster, Massachusetts claim to be Americas first potato chip manufacturer.\n\nIn the 20th century, potato chips spread beyond chef-cooked restaurant fare and began to be mass-produced for home consumption.\nFlavored chips were introduced in the 1950 s.\nPotato Chip revenues are over $15 billion a year worldwide!\n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nGrab a bag of potato chips to enjoy and use #NationalPotatoChipDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nWithin our research, we were unable to identify the creator of National Potato Chip Day.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

He was, however, an attentive bartender, and the bar was a hot spot for the jet set.\nHowever, no mention is found in papers from the era of a hot sandwich on the menu matching the description of a Sloppy Joe, and the man of the same name retired to Spain in 1933.\nAnother claim on the sandwich at the Ye Olde Tavern Inn by Abraham and Bertha Kaled in Sioux City, Iowa that had a loose meat sandwich on their menu in 1934. \nWhoever brought the Sloppy Joe to the world, it was made more convenient when in 1969 Hunts put it in a can and called it Manwich.\nToday many families have their secret recipes that make their Sloppy Joes special.  Whether its an unusual spice, a novel ingredient for sweetening or a homemade tomato sauce, a Sloppy Joe lends itself to originality and personality.  A new flavor is just around the corner.

Kindness and courtesy do go a long way and are noticed by others even if you do not realize it.  Letting someone in front of you in traffic is easy.

Or perhaps it was the smell of baby powder on a newborn that sent you reeling back to the days when your child was an infant.  Maybe it was a combination of ginger and molasses, and suddenly you were in your grandmothers kitchen.\n \nWhatever the fragrance, scents and memory are powerfully linked.  We associate summer with the smell of freshly cut grass, thunderstorms with the smell of the damp air and the acrid scent of sulfur when lightning has struck.  We often connect memories of winter holidays with warm spiced pies and cookies.\n \nThe brain is an amazing thing, and science finds out more about it every day.  Simply put, the olfactory bulb which is responsible for processing all those smells we take in is next to the hippocampus deep inside the brain.  Neuroscientists have discovered that one of the responsibilities of the hippocampus is creating new memories.  With the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus immediately adjacent,  research suggests smell and memory are nearly related.\n \nOur memories are most closely linked to those we have loved.  Your first love may have worn a unique botanical fragrance, or perhaps the uncle who taught you to tie intricate knots smelled of cedar as he told war stories.

Their sacrifices, devotion and concern reflect the bonds of caring for those they have brought into this world.\nSingle parents can and do provide children with the financial, physical, emotional and social support they need to take their places as productive and mature citizens.

Some are edible and nutritious while other weeds have medicinal value.\n \nDo you remember as a small child the fun you had with dandelions? Well, these bright yellow flowers serve a purpose.  Dandelions are a food source for insects and some birds.  Humans eat young dandelion leaves and enjoy tea and wine made from the leaves and flower.

Nutritionally, dandelions contain a source of vitamin A and C, calcium, iron and fiber.\n \nThere are also other edible and medicinal weeds, some of which include:\n \nYellow Dock/Burdock: The taproot of young burdock plants can be harvested and eaten as a root vegetable. Immature flower stalks may also be harvested in late spring before flowers appear.  The flavor of the young stalk resembles that of an artichoke. It is a good source of dietary fiber and certain minerals, including calcium and potassium. It is also used as a medicinal herb.\n \nLambs Quarter: (also known as goosefoot) The leaves of lambs quarter are excellent added to lettuce salads or cooked and used as a replacement for spinach.

It is high in vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, K, B6, calcium and iron, and the seeds are a good source of protein.\n \nPurslane:  It may be eaten as a leaf vegetable, but is considered a weed in the United States. It has a slightly sour and salty taste.  The stems, leaves and flower buds are all edible. Purslane may be used fresh as a salad, stir-fried or cooked as spinach is, and because of its sticky quality, it also is suitable for soups and stews.   It is an excellent source of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants and is high in omega-3 fatty acids.

A fluffy texture is made by beating egg whites until stiff and folding them into the cake batter before baking.  Chiffon cakes tend to be lower in saturated fat than butter cakes, potentially making them healthier than their butter-heavy counterparts.\nThe recipe for the chiffon cake was a closely guarded secret for years.  In the 1920s angel food cake was quite popular, but Henry Baker thought he could make a lighter, richer cake. The insurance salesman turned caterer tinkered with ingredients until in 1927 he came upon the perfect combination of ingredients and methods to produce the airy richness he was looking for.   \nKeeping the recipe to himself, he offered his services to the Brown Derby Restaurant in Los Angeles which catered to Hollywoods elite.

This day was established to recognize physicians, their work and their contributions to society and the community.  On National Doctors Day, we say thank you to our physicians for all that they do for us and our loved ones.\n \nHealthcare today is more complex than ever.  With more advancements, tools and information at their fingertips doctors have an overwhelming job to diagnose and treat their patients every day.  This is the day to honor the men and women who see us 365 days a year.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nTake the opportunity to thank your physician for responding to late night phone calls, working long hours and providing unswerving care. Use #NationalDoctorsDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nMarch 30, 1933, was the first observance of Doctors Day in Winder, Georgia.   Dr. Charles B. Almonds wife, Eudora Brown Almond, wanted to have a day to honor physicians.  On this first day in 1933, greeting cards were mailed and flowers placed on the graves of deceased doctors.  The red carnation is commonly used as the symbolic flower for National Doctors Day.\nThe first ether anesthetic for surgery was administered by Crawford W. Long, M.D. on March 30, 1842, marking the date for Doctors Day.  On that day, before Dr. Long operated to remove a tumor from a mans neck, he administered ether anesthesia.   Following surgery, the man would swear that he felt nothing during the surgery and was not aware of anything until he awoke.\nIn 1991, National Doctors Day was proclaimed by President George Bush. The following is the complete proclamation.\nGeorge Bush\nProclamation 6253 - National Doctors Day, 1991\nFebruary 21, 1991\nBy the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation by President George Bush\nMore than the application of science and technology, medicine is a special calling, and those who have chosen this vocation in order to serve their fellowman understand the tremendous responsibility it entails. Referring to the work of physicians, Dr. Elmer Hess, a former president of the American Medical Association, once wrote: There is no greater reward in our profession than the knowledge that God has entrusted us with the physical care of His people. The Almighty has reserved for Himself the power to create life, but He has assigned to a few of us the responsibility of keeping in good repair the bodies in which this life is sustained. Accordingly, reverence for human life and individual dignity is both the hallmark of a good physician and the key to truly beneficial advances in medicine.\nThe day-to-day work of healing conducted by physicians throughout the United States has been shaped, in large part, by great pioneers in medical research. Many of those pioneers have been Americans. Indeed, today we gratefully remember physicians such as Dr. Daniel Hale Williams and Dr. Charles Drew, who not only advanced their respective fields but also brought great honor and pride to their fellow Black Americans. We pay tribute to doctors such as Albert Sabin and Jonas Salk, whose vaccines for poliomyelitis helped to overcome one of the worlds most dread childhood diseases. We also recall the far-reaching humanitarian efforts of Americans such as Dr. Thomas Dooley, as well as the forward-looking labors of pioneers such as members of the National Institutes of Health, who are helping to lead the Nations fight against AIDS, cancer, and other life-threatening diseases. These and other celebrated American physicians have enabled mankind to make significant strides in the ongoing struggle against disease.\nHowever, in addition to the doctors whose name we easily recognize, there are countless others who carry on the quiet work of healing each day in communities throughout the United States   indeed, throughout the world. Common to the experience of each of them, from the specialist in research to the general practitioner, are hard work, stress, and sacrifice. All those Americans who serve as licensed physicians have engaged in years of study and training, often at great financial cost. Most endure long and unpredictable hours, and many must cope with the conflicting demands of work and family life.\nAs we recognize our Nations physicians for their leadership in the prevention and treatment of illness and injury, it is fitting that we pay special tribute to those who serve as members of the Armed Forces and Reserves and are now deployed in support of Operation Desert Storm. Whether they carry the tools of healing into the heat of battle or stand duty at medical facilities in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere, these dedicated physicians   along with thousands of nurses and other medical personnel   are vital to the success of our mission. We salute them for their courage and sacrifice, and we pray for their safety. We also pray for all those who come in need of their care.\nIn honor of Americas physicians, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 366 (Public Law 101-473), has designated March 30, 1991, as National Doctors Day and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this day.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 30, 1991, as National Doctors Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs and activities.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifteenth.\nGEORGE BUSH\nCitation: John T.

According to witnesses, a group of a dozen hikers headed out on March 29th with enough gear and supplies to return that Sunday evening.\nAllison Rockford of Boulder, Colorado said all the hikers were experienced, and they had no trouble navigating the trail to Two Ocean Lake.\nWe set up camp. Roger even commented it all seemed too easy.\nRoger Moore of Denver was the first to disappear.  We were just getting ready to eat.  He was just gone.  Everything was gone, even his walking stick, Jeff King, also of Boulder, explained.  There wasnt any sign of struggle.\nThe remaining 11 hikers started a search until darkness fell and then huddled around a fire, they took turns keeping watch until morning.\nThey watched in pairs, and they disappeared in pairs as well.  Griffin and Jennifer Rhodes of Douglas, Wyoming, took the first watch and when the next watch came, they were gone.\nJeff and Allison both took a turn and made it through their watch.  Then Bruce Hornsby (Preston, Idaho) and Tom Wolff (Monmouth, Oregon) stood watch.  They havent been seen since.\nBefore daylight returned a piercing sound filled the forest.  It was electronic, high pitched and painful, Allison explained.  I cant describe it any other way.  We all were doubled over in pain.\nThen it suddenly stopped, and the sky was filled with light, as bright as day, Roger continued the description of the events. It was brighter than day. It was blinding!\nThen, according to both Allison and Roger, the only hikers who agreed to speak with us, the light was gone and within moments, forest sounds that had been mysteriously missing from the night returned.  Rustlings of nocturnal animals, an owl called and the mountain seemed back to normal.\nThe next morning the remaining seven made their way to the nearest ranger station.\nAs they made their way along the trail on the southern side of Two Ocean Lake, across the valley and nestled in a low spot, they could see an unnatural formation. It was oddly perfect; disturbingly perfect.  Burned into fresh spring growth were three perfect, identical circles arranged in a triangle.\nRangers searched the area for weeks after the disappearances, but the only sign of the missing hikers that has ever been found was Roger Moores walking stick.\nIt was found at the center of the arrangement of burned circles without a mark on it.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nPrepare your best pranks and practical jokes. Use #AprilFoolsDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nWe would be fools to think we knew precisely when April Fools Day was originally celebrated.\nApril Fools Day shares similarities with other days full of fools, tricks and merry making.\nSome believe the day is celebrated in honor of the trickery Mother Nature plays on us this time of year with her unpredictable weather.\nThe Indian tradition of Holi which is celebrated on March 31st has the same foolery as April Fools day as does the Roman festival of Hilaria which was celebrated on March 25th.\nThe earliest known reference to April Fools day is in Chaucers 1392 Nuns Priests Tale. Even so, the reference is so vague, and possibly not even occurring on the first of April, leaving doubt as to whether it is the first reference.\nOther scholars point to the reformation of the calendar by Pope Gregory and the Gregorian calendar we used today in the 1500s in France. The new year would take place in April, not January as it does now. The theory is that those who continued to celebrate the new year on April 1 were called Poisson dAvril (April fish) and pranks would be played on them.\nIn 1582, France accepted the Gregorian calendar, but reforms had already been taking place.\nIn Britain in 1776, there is a clear and reliable reference to April foolishness in an article in Gentlemans Magazine.  Reference to a custom in the kingdom of making fools of people on the first day of April.  It addresses the day being the culmination of an eight-day feast and the beginning of a new year.\nNewspapers, television, radio and social media have had their fun on April Fools Day. Check out all this April 1 foolishness:\n\nTimes of London reported in 1992 that Belgium was negotiating to join Holland.\nThe Evening Star of Islington advertised in 1864 a display of donkeys at the Agricultural Hall the next day. Those who arrived early soon realized who the donkeys on display really were.\nIn 1950, The Progress in Clearfield Pennsylvania published a picture of a UFO flying over the town. Claiming to have scooped larger publications of the first ever published picture of a real flying saucer.\nIn 2008, the BBC presented a documentary on flying penguins.\n\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

The answer is the penny, which we recognize on National One Cent Day.\n\nThe United States first issued a one-cent coin produced by a private mint in 1787.  It was designed by Benjamin Franklin.  On one side it read Mind Your Business and the other We Are One.  This coin was made of 100% copper was larger than todays penny and came to be known as the Fugio cent.\n\nIt wasnt until 1792 that the United States Mint was first created.  The first coins struck by the newly established mint were called Chain cents, or Flowing Hair Chain Cents by collectors today.  On one side of the was coin a circle of 13 links of chain representing the 13 colonies. On the reverse was an image of a woman with flowing hair, otherwise known as Liberty.\n\nThe one cent coin was reduced in size in the 1850s to make the coin more economical and easier to handle.  In 1856, the mint produced the Flying Eagle cent with a wreath on the reverse side.\n\nThis coin was soon replaced with the Indian Head cent in 1859 which quickly became popular and remained in circulation for decades.\n\nTodays one cent coin is made of copper and zinc and has borne the image of President Abraham Lincoln since 1909.  From 1959  to 2008, the reverse featured the Lincoln Memorial. Four different reverse designs in 2009 honored Lincolns 200th birthday depicting various scenes from his lifetime and a new, permanent reverse - the Union Shield - was introduced in 2010.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nOn National One Cent Day,  you can research the history of the penny and also learn about saving your cents.

The use of naturally occurring yeasts and friendly bacteria versus cultivated yeast causes the bread to have a slightly sour, but pleasant taste.  \nMost likely the first form of leavening available to bakers, it is believed sourdough originated in Ancient Egyptian times around 1500 BC.  It did remain the usual form of leavening into the European Middle Ages. During the California Gold Rush, sourdough was the principal bread made in Northern California and is still a part of the culture of San Francisco today.\nThe bread was so common at that time the word sourdough became a nickname for the gold prospectors. In The Yukon and Alaska, a sourdough is also a nickname given to someone who has spent an entire winter north of the Arctic Circle, and it refers to their tradition of protecting their sourdough during the coldest months by keeping it close to their body. The sourdough tradition was also carried into Alaska and western Canadian territories during the Klondike Gold Rush.\nSan Francisco sourdough is the most famous sourdough bread made in the United States today.  In contrast to sourdough production in other areas of the country, the San Francisco variety has remained in continuous production since 1849, with some bakeries able to trace their starters back to Californias Gold Rush period. Many restaurant chains keep it as a menu staple. Sourdough bread is a great side to your soup or stew or toasted with your morning cereal.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nEnjoy this delicious recipe: San Francisco Sourdough Bread recipe.\nUse #SourdoughBreadDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\n We were unable to find the origin or the creator of National Sourdough Bread Day.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

Male ferrets are called Hobs and female ferrets are called Jills.  Their offspring are called Kits. The whole family is called a Business. A part of the mustelid family, ferrets are carnivores and are joined by the otter, badger, weasel, marten, mink and wolverine.\nThey are quite crafty hunters and have been domesticated for over 2,000 years for just that purpose.  Used to ferret out and kill mostly vermin that would otherwise grow out of control, ferrets were a useful tool. Their razor sharp teeth are definitely those of a carnivore.\nThese wildly, curious creatures have been recently domesticated as pets in the last few decades.  While their skill in the wild may have been considered masterful, as a pet they can be a mischievous handful if not properly trained.  Highly intelligent, they can be trained to do an assortment of tricks and to use a litter box.  A social animal, they do require attention and preferably a ferret companion.\nLike other mustelids, ferrets have scent glands that produce a musky, often offensive odor.\n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nLearn more about ferrets.

This food holiday is a classic favorite of many.  The average American will have eaten over 2000 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches by the time they graduate from high school.\nPeanut butter was considered a delicacy in the early 1900s and was only served in New York Citys finest tea rooms.  In a May 1896 article published in the Good Housekeeping magazine, a recipe urged homemakers to use a meat grinder to make peanut butter and spread the result on bread.  That same year, in June, the culinary magazine Table Talk, published a peanut butter sandwich recipe.\nIt is thought to be that the first reference of peanut butter paired with jelly on bread, to be issued in the United States, was by Julia Davis Chandler in 1901.  In the late 1920s, the price of peanut butter declined, and the sandwich became very popular with children.\nAccording to the Peanut Board, during World War II, both peanut butter and jelly were part of the United States soldiers military ration list.\nIn 1968, The J.M.

He had a vast library of 6,500 volumes.\nJefferson was not only a lawyer but a scientist of agriculture, paleontology, and astronomy. Immensely curious,  he kept detailed records of the weather and eventually established weather observers across his home state of Virginia.\nJefferson served as minister to France, Secretary of State in President Washingtons Cabinet and ran for President for the first time in 1796 only to be elected Vice President to his opponent, John Adams due to a flaw in the Constitution.\nFour years later the same fault in the document caused a tie within the same party between Aaron Burr and Jefferson with Jefferson assuming the Presidency.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nUse #NationalThomasJeffersonDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nBy Presidential Proclamation 2276 on March 21, 1938, Franklin D.

They can hear frequencies ten times or more above the upper limit of what adult humans can and are capable of making a broad range of sounds using nasal air sacs located just below the blowhole.\nLiving in pods of up to a dozen dolphins, they are highly social animals. Pods do merge in areas where there is an abundance of food, forming superpods, which may exceed 1,000 dolphins. Dolphins can, and do, establish strong bonds within their pods and will stay with injured or ill individuals, even helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed.\nYou will see the dolphins frequently leaping above the waters surface. They do this for various reasons; when traveling, jumping saves them energy as there is less friction while in the air, this is known as porpoising.  Some other explanations for leaping include orientation, social display, fighting, non-verbal communication, entertainment and attempting to dislodge parasites.\nThe United States National Marine Mammal Foundation conducted a study that revealed that dolphins, like humans, develop a natural form of type 2 diabetes which may lead to a better understanding of the disease and new treatments for both humans and dolphins.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nUse #NationalDolphinDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nNational Dolphin Day is listed as part of the American Veterinary Medical Association Pet Health Awareness Events.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

Varying in color, design, and transparency, a nylon stocking (also known as hose) is a close-fitting, variously elastic garment worn the same as socks or tights.\nStockings worn before the 1890s were made of woven cloth such as cotton, linen, wool or silk.   Before the 1920s, womens stockings were worn for warmth.  As hemlines of womens dresses rose in the 1920s, women began to wear stockings over their exposed legs.  These 1920s stockings were sheer, made first of silk or rayon, followed by nylon after 1940.\nChemical company DuPonts introduction of nylon in 1939 began a high demand for stockings in the United States.  As nylon stockings were inexpensive, durable and shear, up to 4 million pairs would be purchased each day.\nOn February 11, 1942, as America entered World War II, DuPont ceased production of nylon stockings and switching their focus to the manufacture of parachutes, airplane cords and rope.  This created a mass shortage followed by a black market for stockings.  At the end of World War II, DuPont resumed production of the stockings but could not meet the demand leading to nylon riots in American stores. In time, DuPont was able to increase its output.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, the first pantyhose made its appearance.  Film and theater productions had stockings sewn to the briefs of actresses and dancers, as seen in popular films such as Daddy Long Legs. Unlike stockings, pantyhose did not require a garter belt to hold the stockings up.\nPantyhose were introduced in 1959, providing a convenient alternative to stockings which led to a decline in their sales.  In 1970, for the first time, United States sales of pantyhose exceeded stocking sales and has remained the same ever since.   In 1987, there was a slight decline in sales in pantyhose due to the newly invented hold-ups. However, they remain the most purchased kind of hosiery.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\n Use #NylonStockingDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nWithin our research, we were unable to find the origin of National Stocking Day.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

It is Aviation Maintenance Technician Day.\nWe all know the story of Orville and Wilbur Wright, Kitty Hawk and the experiment of human flight.\nHow many of us know the name Charles Edward Taylor? He came to work for the Wrights in 1902 when the research turned to powered flight.  The automobile companies couldnt supply an engine both light enough and powerful enough for flight.\nEnter Taylor.  A machinist by trade, with a metal lathe, drill press, and other hand tools, he built the 12-horse power engine which propelled the Wrights aeroplane 20 feet above the wind-swept North Carolina beach. The longest flight lasted 59 seconds for a distance of 852 feet.  It took Taylor 6 weeks to build the engine and yet, history books rarely mention the man who helped make the historic December 17, 1903, flight possible.\nBeing on the cusp of the aeronautics industry, Taylor continued to design aircraft engines for the Wright brothers as well as teaching them to build their own. When the first airport was established (by the Wrights) he was named the airport manager.\nThe partnership continued when the Wright brothers were awarded a military contract for the first military plane with Taylor designing and building the engine.\nTaylors adventures continued in 1911 when William Randolph Hearst offered up a cash award to the first pilot to fly across the United States in 30 days or less. Cal Rodgers, a young pilot, accepted the challenge and hired Charles Taylor as his mechanic.\nRodgers made it, landing and crashing from New York to Pasadena, with Taylor trailing along in a car.\nCharles Taylor continued in the field of aviation maintenance for more than 60 years. Like Taylor, aviation maintenance technicians around the world work in the background, keeping civilian and military aircraft safe.

Its National Rocky Road Day!  In the United States, the most popular way to eat Rocky Road is in ice cream.\nAlthough there are many variations, traditionally, Rocky Road ice cream was composed of chocolate ice cream, nuts, and marshmallows.  Today, there are variations with vanilla ice cream, cholate chips and almonds.\nPeople have been enjoying this delicious combination for many years. There are varying accounts of the origin of this ice cream, as there often are when a popular item invention comes along. Sometime during the late 1920s William Dreyer used inspiration from his partner Joseph Edys chocolate candy to make rocky road ice cream. Dryer did something he was probably told a hundred times not to do. He used his wifes sewing scissors to chop up marshmallows and walnuts and added them to chocolate ice cream. Of course, it tasted good, so he was probably forgiven for using her good sewing shears for anything but fabric!\nAnother who laid claim to the creation of rocky road ice cream was George Farren. He had simply blended a candy bar into chocolate ice cream creating the creamy dessert.\nSoon after, the stock market crashed, and the ice cream was given the name Rocky Road to bring smiles to faces during the Great Depression.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nEnjoy a bowl of Rocky Road Ice Cream, some Rocky Road candy, bars, cake or other Rocky Road dessert!

This beverage has a notorious record of blurring the lines of history and the law, turning common men (and women) into criminals and common criminals into legends.\nMoonshine traditionally is an illegally distilled spirit. Mostly made from a corn mash, moonshine is a distilled whiskey that is typically produced by an individual illegally without a permit. Also known as white lightning, mountain dew, homebrew, hillbilly pop, rotgut and too many more to list here.\nProhibition\nDistilling skills first came to the United States during the 1830s with the Scotch-Irish as they settled in Virginia.\nTemperance laws and prohibition legislation were passed in several states before the Civil War, but it wasnt until the turn of the century that the temperance movement picked up steam. By the time the 18th Amendment was ratified early in 1919, over half the country was dry.\nProhibition lasted 13 years. It created a demand for moonshine unlike any that may have existed before. Moonshine became big business overnight.\nModern Moonshine\nThese days, moonshine in the legal sense has a following.  Small-batch distilleries are producing legal moonshine giving moonshiners a new name.  Bringing moonshine out of the woods and going up against other whiskies for a place on the shelf.  Many are packaging their homebrews in canning jars embracing their rich history while at the same time experimenting with flavor and branching out with food pairing similar to that of wine and beer.\nTrivia\n\nShepherd was Uncle Jesses CB handle on the Dukes of Hazzard. Sweet Tillie was the name of his Ford LTD/Galaxie in the first episode - his moonshine runner.\nThe Xs on the moonshine jugs symbol represents the number of times a batch was run through the still. If marked XXX, the moonshine is pure alcohol.\nWhat do Esther Clark, Edna Giard, Stella Beloumant, Mary Wazeniak all have in common? They were all bootleggers. Bootlegging was an equal opportunity profession.\nLavinia Gilman was a bootlegger, too.  At 80 years old she ran a 300 gallon still in Montana.  The judge suspected her son was the true culprit, though.\nDuring prohibition, there were many ways to transport bootlegged moonshine.  Faking a funeral was a convenient ruse to move the product.

Some of the gardening activities that are excellent for working your muscles and for burning calories include: weeding, digging, spading, planting, pruning, mowing, raking, and walking.\nMany of us do not realize the amount of good exercise that we can get while working outside in the garden.

Incorporating stretching into a gardening routine may help to prevent injury, much like it does for any athletic endeavor.  Adding those squats will contribute to building or maintaining muscle and extra steps may make gardening more aerobic if it increases the heart rate.\nOther suggestions to get the most exercise out of your gardening:\n\nStart slowly.  Just like any new workout program, small steps.\nUse the right and left hands equally.  When raking or shoveling, switch hands every 5-10 minutes to give each side a good workout.\nMake sure to breathe.

It is played by holding the free end of the string, allowing gravity or the force of a throw to spin the yo-yo and unwind the string, then allowing the yo-yo to wind itself back again.  This is called yo-yoing.\nIt is believed that the yo-yo was first invented in ancient Greece.  There is a Greek vase painting, from 500 BC, that shows a boy playing with a yo-yo.  The yo-yo was made popular in America when Donald F. Duncan, Sr. manufactured the Duncan Yo-Yo in the early 1900s.  The name Yo-Yo was first registered as a trademark in 1932.\n\nIn 1999, the Duncan Yo-Yo was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester, New York.\nThe National Yo-Yo Museum is located in Chico, California.\nYo-yoing is a term often used to describe a person fluctuating between two difficult decisions.\n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nUse  #NationalYo-YoDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nFounded in 1990 in Arcade, NY by Daniel Volk, National Yo-Yo Day celebrates the yo-yo on June 6, the date of Donald F.

On National Earl Day we honor those legends named Earl.\nIts an uncommon name these days, but hopefully, those who have the privilege of being so named have earned it.\nOne enterprising man by the name of Earl Baltes went from bandleader to dirt race track owner in 1954 when he transformed the El dora Ballroom into Eldora Speedway, a quarter-mile dirt track in 1954. By 1958, it was expanded to its present day half mile length.\nBy 1962, Eldora was a favored track for sprint cars, and Baltes began promoting more tracks and events.  Across Ohio and Indiana, Baltes promoted some of the highest paying short track races.   Ohio named a portion route 118 Earl Baltes Highway.\nFast forward to 2016, one year after Baltes passed, and Eldora Speedway and the events he created are still going strong. Other events such as the World 100 started in 1971, and the Kings Royal part, of the World of Outlaws Sprint Car Series, are held annually at Eldora Speedway as well.\nAbout the same time Baltes was making a name for himself, another Earl was picking his way into bluegrass music history. Becoming known for his three-fingered banjo picking, Earl Scruggs was uniquely talented. In his early career, he was paired with Lester Flatt as The Foggy Mountain Boys. Together they recorded country and bluegrass hits.\nThe Foggy Mountain Boys split in 1969 and Scruggs continued to make music with his sons. Influenced by his sons musical tastes, he became interested in the sound of an electrified banjo.\nFrom a Beverly Hillbilly to Dueling Banjos, Earl Scruggs had quite an electrifying and influential career. He left an enduring mark on bluegrass music. Scruggs died on March 28, 2012.\nWhile Scruggss popular bluegrass song Pearl, Pearl, Pearl was being released, Earl the Pearl, aka Earl Monroe, was just starting his college basketball career. A few years later in 1967, he would be the first round pick for the Baltimore Bullets.

Get suave with a perhaps less expensive pair for National Sunglasses Day.\nRay-Ban 3138 Shooter\n\nPhoto: Raoul Duke\nThese yellow-tinted aviator shooters were not first worn by Johnny Depp in the film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but that is where they first became famous. The sunglasses, which have a small circle in between the lenses that is said to aid in hunting or shooting, were regularly worn by Hunter S. Thompson, the author of the novel that inspired the film. Shooters come in different color tints.\nRay-Ban Wayfarer\n\nPhoto: iloveretro.com\nAt their introduction in 1956, Ray-Bans Wayfarers were almost instantly popular because of the revolutionary plastic frame, a distinct diversion from the metal-framed sunglasses that were popular at the time. The sunglasses continued to be popular throughout the 50s and 60s but then slumped in popularity until the late 2000s when artists like Katy Perry and Bruno Mars wore them in their music videos.\nRound and Oversized\n\nPhoto: rdujour.com\nOften known today simply as Jackie Os, these sunglasses were popularized by former First Lady and fashion icon Jackie Kennedy during the years that her husband was president. They are instantly recognizable by their large round shape and still serve to make quite a fashion statement when worn today. Its hard to wear these sunglasses and not channel some of the grace, style and elegance that Jackie was so famous for.\nGold-rimmed Aviator\n\nPhoto: Oliver Cheshire\nThe history of the archetypal Ray-Ban Aviators begins in the 1930s when US Army pilots were reporting that the glare from the sun was giving them headaches and altitude sickness. American company Bausch & Lomb created what was originally known as Anti-Glare, sunglasses with plastic frames and green lenses. Just a year later they were remodeled with metal frames and rebranded as Aviators, how we still know them today.\nThe Clubmaster\n\nPhoto: fashionologieedina.wordpress.com\nClubmasters are a type of browline sunglasses, which gets its name from the fact that the bold upper part of the frames frame the lenses like the eyebrow frames the eyes. Ray-Ban introduced the Clubmaster in the 1980s when Bruce Willis wore a pair of browline Shuron Ronsirs on the series Moonlighting. The Clubmasters gained popularity and quickly became the third best-selling sunglasses of the 1980s, after Ray-Bans Wayfarer and Aviator styles.\nOliver Peoples Gregory Peck\n\nPhoto: Cateshill.com\nNot only did Gregory Peck win an Oscar for his role as Atticus Finch in the 1962 film To Kill A Mockingbird, but he also won a fair amount of acclaim for the glasses frames he wore in the film. These frames are once again popular today, thanks partly to their reintroduction in 2011 when Oliver Peoples released a new model to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the novel that inspired the film. Don these on National Sunglasses Day and channel your inner Atticus Finch.\nOliver Goldsmith Manhattan\n\nPhoto: everythingaudrey.com\nAudrey Hepburn is one of films most well-known faces, and it was usually with a pair of Oliver Goldsmith Manhattans framing her eyes. These large, rounded-square sunglasses were first made famous when Hepburn wore them in Breakfast at Tiffanys, a role that was originally supposed to be played by Marilyn Monroe. The glasses, instantly recognizable today, are still popular.\nRose-colored Glasses\n\nPhoto: Allyn Scura\nTo see the world through rose-colored glasses is a phrase that means to view the world in a perpetual optimistic, perhaps naive, and unrealistic way. It remains in question what the origin of the phrase is, though there are some interesting and possible theories. One theory suggests that early mapmakers used rose petals to clean the lenses of the glasses. Not only would the natural oils protect the glass, but they would also leave a rose-colored stain.\nFor National Sunglasses Day this year, decide which of the above personalities or looks youd like to emulate and grab a pair of sunglasses to match. Check in with an online glasses retailer for the styles of frames and lenses you want and celebrate in style while protecting your eyes at the same time.\nArticle Contributed by Bethany Cleg\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

In the tales, Paul Bunyan was almost always accompanied by his companion, Babe the Blue Ox.\n\nFirst appearing in print in 1906, in a story published by Northern Michigan journalist James MacGillivray, Bunyans character originated in folktales circulated among lumberjacks in the Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada.  One account states that the tales began during the Papineau Rebellion of 1837.  In 1914, the stories  were reworked by William Laughead, for a logging companys advertising campaign, and found a new widespread popularity.  It was the 1922 edition of Laugheads tales that inspired many others and soon the character was widely known across all of the United States and Canada.\nStatue of Paul Bunyan in Akeley, MN\nThe Paul Bunyan legend tells that it took five storks to carry him as a newborn and as he was a little older and clapped and laughed, it broke windows.  The legend continues that he sawed off the legs of his parents bed, in the middle of the night, when he was only seven months old and that the Grand Canyon was formed as he and Babe the Blue Ox walked through dragging his axe behind him. The myth of the Great Lakes being formed by Bunyan needing to create a watering hole for Babe to drink from is another popular one told by many.\n\nMany cities in the north-central section of the United States, claim the title as the official home of Paul Bunyan.  \n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nRead one or several of the Paul Bunyan tales.

Fried clams are an iconic food in the New England states.  They tend to be served at seaside clam shacks or roadside restaurants. The clams are dipped in milk and coated with a combination of regular, corn, and/or pastry flour. Then the coated clams are fried in oil. They can be clam strips (sliced parts of hard-shell clams) or whole soft-shell clams. Whole soft-shell clams impart a fuller flavor. However, some restaurants remove the clams neck.\nIn 1914, Lawrence Henry Chubby Woodman and his wife Bessie opened a small concession stand on Main Street in Essex, Massachusetts.  On weekends they sold small grocery items, homemade potato chip and fresh clams that Chubby dug himself.  At first, business was slow but on July 3, 1916, things began to change.\nIt was on that day a local fisherman named Tarr was visiting the stand, and Chubby complained, Business was slower than a couple of snails headed\nfried clams in box\nuphill. Tarr, while nibbling on the tasty homemade potato chips, noticed a bucket of clams nearby and jokingly said, Why dont you fry up some of your clams? If theyre as tasty as those potato chips of yours, youll never have to worry about having enough customers. Fried clams were unheard of, and Tarrs comment was rewarded with cold stares from two other customers. Thats ridiculous! said one. The other one remarked, Clams have shells. The poor fisherman muttered, I wasnt serious. It was a joke. I know you cant fry clams like chips!\nHowever, when the three men left, Chubby and Bessie started to think about it.  What if they did fry up some of the clams and sold them? If they tasted good, they would have created a way to increase the demand for their own shucked clams. Lets try it, Bessie said as she tossed a slab of lard into the fry pot usually used to make potato chips. They shucked some clams and experimented with different batters, having some locals try them out.  When the overall verdict was delicious! they knew they were on to something big.\nThe next day, during the 4th of July parade, Chubby and Bessie presented the first fried clams to the citizens of Essex, and the Yankee appetite has never been the same since. A year later a Boston fish market advertised that it was now equipped to serve the new tasty treat - fried clams. And Howard Johnson, owner of a chain of restaurants on the East Coast, came himself to learn how to make fried clams from Chubby.\nClam Plate\nOn the backside of their wedding certificate, Lawrence and Bessie wrote what they considered to be important family events.

So, raise your glass and join all of the others in this celebration!\nDaiquiri is a family of cocktails whose main ingredients are rum, citrus juice (typically lime) and sugar.\nTasting of sunshine and beaches, it might be hard to believe the daiquiri was likely invented by men blasting away in the mines of a small community off the coast of Cuba.  Jennings Cox, an American engineer, supervised a mining operation located in a village named Daiquiri in 1898 during the Spanish-American War.  Every day after work Cox and his employees would gather at the Venus bar. Then one day Cox mixed up Bacardi, lime, sugar in a tall glass of ice. Naming the new beverage after the Daiquiri mines, the drink soon became a staple in Havana.  Eventually, shaved ice was used and sometimes lemons or both lemons and limes.\nIn 1909, Admiral Lucius W. Johnson, a U.S. Navy medical officer, tried Coxs drink and subsequently introduced it to the Army and Navy Club in Washington, D.C.  The popularity of the Daiquiri then increased over the next few decades.\n\nThe Daiquiri was one of the favorite drinks of writer Ernest Hemingway and President John F. Kennedy.\n\nThis drink is sometimes served frozen, combined and poured from a blender eliminating the need for manual pulverization.  Drinks such as the frozen Daiquiri are often commercially made in machines which produce a texture similar to a smoothie and come in a wide variety of flavors.  Another way to create a frozen Daiquiri is by using frozen limeade, which provides the required texture, sweetness and sourness all at one time.  \nHOW TO OBSERVE\nEnjoy National Daiquiri Day gathered together with your friends and a glass of regular or frozen Daiquiri (Remember to always drink responsibly and never to drink and drive).

Warmer felt hats were donned this time of year, replacing the lighter, cooler straw hats. Etiquette dictated what hats were worn for which occasion. Donning and doffing the hat (mostly required for men) was a good behavior learned at an early age.\nPrimarily made from wool, felt can also be made from the fur of other animals such as rabbit and beaver. Beaver was popular during the 16th and 17th centuries, but over trapping depleted the population.\n\nThe phrase a mad as a hatter comes from the use of mercury nitrate in haberdasheries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Over time, daily exposure to this metal caused these tradesmen to develop dementia, tics and other symptoms causing people to believe they had gone mad.\n\nOver the centuries, many styles of felt hats have made their debut.  We can identify an era by many of them.  The Quaker will quickly be identified by its buckle, and the stovepipe reminds most Americans of one of its most beloved presidents.

Both varieties have similar flavors and are interchangeable in recipes, except where the color is important.\nThe traditional formula involves steeping dried peppermint or Corsican mint leaves in grain alcohol for several weeks (creating a naturally green color), followed by filtration and the addition of sugar.\nCr me de menthe is used as an ingredient in several cocktails, such as the Grasshopper and the Stinger. Because of mints digestive qualities, cr me de menthe served is often as an after-dinner drink. Also popular in the kitchen, it is used in many recipes as a flavoring.

Situational awareness is the foundation of ones personal safety since it focuses on being aware and paying attention to your environment. Situational awareness is really just another word for mindfulness and developing it will make you more present in daily activities, which in turn helps you make better decisions in all aspects of life.\nThis day highlights the importance of using situational awareness skills in everyday life to stay out of harms way. Harm may come in the form of walking in front of a moving car or that of an assailant, both of which can happen from any myriad of distractions which cause one not to be aware of the surroundings and situation.\nIn a dangerous situation, being aware of a threat even seconds before may keep someone safe by giving them time to act instead of react. The lack of or inadequate situational awareness has been identified as one of the primary factors in accidents attributed to human error.  Although this skill is lacking in many of modern society, our ancestors used it to great utility to survive. It has been extensively taught for decades to law enforcement and the military, but it is not exclusive to them. Most experts agree that it is the number one skill to learn for the safety of everyone.\nThe concept of situational awareness was identified during World War I by Oswald Boelke who realized the importance of gaining an awareness of the enemy before the enemy gained a similar awareness, and devised methods for accomplishing this.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nDiscuss its importance with those around you.

On September 26, we commemorate the day of his birth and celebrate his legendary wit, wisdom and enduring story.  \nIn Fort Wayne, Indiana in Johnny Appleseed Park there is a grave marking the spot where the legendary sower of apple seeds rests. He was born John Chapman on September 26, 1774, in Leominster, Massachusetts to Nathaniel and Elizabeth Simons Chapman. Not much is known about his early life other than his mother died when he was two. His father packed up Johnny and his sister (an infant brother had died the previous year) and moved to Springfield, Massachusetts. His father served as a Minuteman and fought at Bunker Hill.\nThen in 1797, Chapman shows up in northwestern Pennsylvania propagating his apple seeds and working his way steadily into the frontier of West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and eventually as far west as Illinois and Iowa and as far north as Michigan and Wisconsin.\nIn his wake, he left orchards and the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, a Swedish spiritual leader whose books he would buy with whatever payment he might receive for his endeavors. In turn, Johnny would give the books away as he traveled and planted.\nMostly, though, he planted his seeds and seedlings for free along with his wisdom, his broad-brimmed pasteboard hat keeping the sun from his eyes as he went. Often shoeless, he traveled mostly by foot and sometimes by horseback or canoe. His appearance was nearly as noteworthy as his accomplishments, but so was his kindness. There was always a place at the table if Johnny Appleseed were to come visiting.\nThere are many stories told that the man would travel many miles to nurse an ailing orchard when word would reach him of its poor condition. Bringing the trees back to health would be his chief endeavor while dispersing wisdom, care and kindness as he did.\nAcross the Midwest, landmarks pepper the countryside honoring the man that brought fruit to the frontier. Warren County, Pennsylvania lays claim to Johnny Appleseeds first tree nursery.\nMansfield, Ohio honors the man with a monument in South Park.\nIn his hometown of Springfield, Massachusetts there is an entire park named after the man who nurtured the land and made apple trees bloom across a young nation.\nJohnny Appleseed Day is celebrated on either March 11th or September 26th. The September date is Appleseeds acknowledged birth date. The March date is sometimes preferred due to the planting season. While there is some vagueness concerning Appleseeds death and burial, it is known he became ill in early March and passed soon after.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nAs the fruit ripens on these autumn days, savor a deliciously sweet apple and use #JohnnyAppleseedDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nOur Research was unable to find the creator of National Johnny Appleseed Day.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

According to an expert cupper (a professional coffee taster), there are four components of a perfect cup: aroma, body, acidity, and flavor.\nFrom the moment the average coffee lover opens a fresh bag of coffee beans, the aroma beckons, percolating the senses. Even those who dont drink coffee tend to enjoy the fragrance a roasted bean casts.\n \nWhen determining the body of a coffee, the bean, the roast, and the brew are all factors. The bean affects the texture of the coffee, whether its silky, creamy, thick or thin on the tongue and throat. However, the darker the roast and how it is brewed will alter the feel of a coffees body, too. Grandpas motor oil blend versus the coffee shop around the corners silky smooth, well-practiced grind have entirely different bodies.\nThe region a coffee is grown determines its acidity. The higher the elevation the coffee grows, the higher the quality and the acidity. These coffees are considered brighter, dryer, even sparkling by cuppers.\nWhen it comes down to it, coffee lovers cherish the flavor as well as the caffeinated boost this roasted bean gives morning or night, black or with cream and sugar. Hot or cold it provides enjoyment even when decaffeinated!\n \n\n\nThere are many legendary accounts of how coffee first came to be, but the earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or the knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the Sufi monasteries around Mokha in Yemen.  It was here coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed, much like they are prepared today. Yemeni traders brought coffee back to their homeland from Ethiopia and began to cultivate the seed.\nIn 1670, coffee seeds were smuggled out of the Middle East by Baba Budan, as he strapped seven coffee seeds onto his chest.

For ages gone by, many of the ghost stories around the world center around historical records or literature. Their existence has been widely debated in religion, science and academia. Even their use by Shakespeare and other playwrights is often considered a continuation of that discussion in the midst of the Renaissance stage.\nSeeking paranormal activity isnt limited to crumbling ruins and darkened, forgotten corners of the world. Both Ann Bolyens ghost in the Tower of London and several haunted spaces in the White House in Washington, D.C. are two very public and populated places which come to mind. Enthusiasts bring attention to historical properties and have an interest in preservation as well. From Civil War-era towns like Old Salt Sulphur Springs in Virgina to ghost walks in old opera houses like Rohs Opera House in Kentucky and train loving ghosts in Colorado, many locations are ready for sleuthing on National Ghost Hunting Day.\nPerhaps its the anticipation for the novice who has yet to experience the thrill of witnessing a restless soul making contact for the first time that lures him into a first haunted journey. From an eerie ghost story read by flashlight under the bedsheets or unexplained blur on a snapshot, the investigators interest may be held by just the prospect of a spirit lingering nearby.  Actual sightings are rare and fleeting.\nWith the increase of movies and television shows going on the hunt, interest has grown. Societies around the world continue to develop methods of proving the existence of ghosts, spirits and other paranormal activity. Typically, a ghost hunting team will attempt to collect evidence that they see as supportive of paranormal activity. Devices such as an EMF meter, digital thermometer, handheld and static digital video cameras, audio recorders and computers are all part of a teams tool box.  They also employ traditional techniques like conducting interviews and researching the history of a site.\nHowever, skeptics remain. Considered a pseudoscience by a majority of educators, academics and science writers, ghost hunting leads to noble acts, including the preservation of historical sites, the American Folklore Story and the integration of known scientific tools for reaching into challenging dimensional theories. It is with a tremendous sense of discovery and enthusiasm that National Ghost Hunting Day is celebrated.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nNational Ghost Hunting Day will kick off with the Shot-Gun start at The ScareFest in Lexington, KY.  To join in the coast-to-coast simultaneous hunt, find a satellite team near you! National ghost hunting societies will be participating across the country investigating local venues.

The butter should be soft, but cool, almost room temperature.  What to do if you want to bake but you forgot the butter in the refrigerator? Leave each stick of butter in its wrapper and place it in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave the butter on high for 10 seconds. Turn each stick of butter 2 turns. Microwave for 10 more seconds. Turn each stick of butter 1 turn.  While turning, test how soft the butter is.  Depending on your microwave, you may want to stop here and prepare the rest of your ingredients.  If the butter still needs more time, microwave for 5-10 more seconds.\nCream the butter and sugar together to create a smooth, fluffy mixture so the sugar isnt grainy.\nBeat in each egg separately.\nUse proper measuring cups for the job.  Liquid measuring cups are larger than the amount needed, clear with lines for visual confirmation of the amount of liquid and have a spout for pouring. Dry measuring cups are designed to be filled to the top with the exact amount.\nMeasure your flour correctly.  Dont scoop the flour out of the container.  It will pack too much into the cup.  Use a spoon to lightly sift the flour into the measuring cup, then carefully level the excess off with the edge of a knife.\nLine metal baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats to prevent the cookies from spreading too far.  Or, use a baking stone to have evenly baked cookies every time.\n\n\n \n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\n\n\nTo celebrate National Homemade Cookies Day, try one of these tasty cookie recipes:\nBeths Spicy Oatmeal Cookies\nPeanut Butter Cup Cookies\nMonster Chip Cookies\nHomemade Lemon Sugar Cookies\nUse #HomemadeCookiesDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nWithin our research, we were unable to find the origin of National Homemade Cookies Day.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

They may have chewed it for enjoyment, to stave off hunger or to freshen their breath much like we do today.  The sources used to make gum resulted in minty and sweet chewable globs of wax or sap resin that fulfilled that human urge to gnaw.  It was unlikely they were capable of producing glossy, pink bubbles worthy of jealous pokes from siblings.  However, waking up with it stuck in your hair was still a possibility.  \nVarious forms of chewing gum have existed since the Neolithic period. In 2007, a British archeology student discovered a 5,000-year-old piece of chewing gum which was made from bark tar with tooth imprints in it. Presumed to be the oldest piece of chewing gum, it was found in Kierikki, Yli-li, Finland.  Made from bark tar, the gum was believed to have antiseptic properties and other medicinal advantages.\n\nMany other cultures chewed gum made from the resin of the mastic tree, from plants, grasses, and other resins.\nIn 1848, John B. Curtis developed and sold the first commercial chewing gum which was called The State of Maine Pure Spruce Gum.\nAround 1850, a gum made from paraffin wax was developed and surpassed the spruce gum in popularity.\nDecember 28, 1869, William Semple filed an early patent on chewing gum, patent number 98,304.\nStudies show chewing gum helps improve memory, reduce stress and increase alertness.\nChewing sugar-free gum improves overall oral hygiene while also helping to curb cravings and improving digestion.\n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nCelebrate National Chewing Gum Day by buying a pack of your favorite flavor of chewing gum and sharing it with your friends.

Celebrate zealously, then take a bath.  \nA sweet marshmallow-like spread called Marshmallow Creme was invented in 1917 by Archibald Query in Somerville, Massachusetts. In 1913 during World War I, Emma and Amory Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme and published a recipe for a peanut butter and marshmallow creme sandwich, which is the earliest known example of a Fluffernutter.\nQuery sold his recipe for Marshmallow Creme to Durkee-Mower, Inc. in 1920, who renamed it Marshmallow Fluff. Over 100 years later they continue to sell it under that name today.\nIt was in 1960 that the term Fluffernutter was created by an advertising agency for Durkee-Mower in an attempt to effectively market the peanut butter and marshmallow sandwich.\n\nBeyond the history of Fluffernutter, lets explore the culinary side of this extraordinary combination of sweet and nutty.

Typically considerably sweet, liqueurs are usually not aged long. However, a resting period during their production allows the flavors to marry.\nWith the broad selection of spirits available in seasonal, fragrant and often curious flavors (vodkas and rums in particular) there is often confusion of liqueurs and liquors.  In the United States and Canada, spirits are frequently called liquor.   The most reliable rule of thumb to follow is that liqueurs are a sweeter, syrupy consistency, while liquors are not.  Most of the liqueurs have a lower alcohol content than spirits. However, some do contain as much as 55% ABV.\nIn some parts of the United States, liqueurs may also be called cordials or schnapps.\nHistorically, liqueurs descend from herbal medicines prepared by monks in Italy as early as the 13th century.  These often bitter herbs were steeped and sweetened with sugar to make them more palatable to the monks ailing patients. The curatives potency received a restful boost from its alcohol content as well.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nGo out for a drink of liqueur with friends.

In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, An American Dictionary of the English Language; it took twenty-seven years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-six languages, including Old English (Anglo-Saxon), German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Arabic and Sanskrit.\n\nWebster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in Paris, France, at the University of Cambridge.  His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. \nAs a spelling reformer, he believed that the English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex so in his dictionary he introduced American English spellings, replacing colour with color, substituting wagon for waggon and printing center instead of centre.  Webster also added American words such as skunk and squash that did not appear in British dictionaries.  He believed The United States should be as independent in literature as she is in politics.  Some of his changes didnt catch on, however.  Dropping the silent e from the end of some words like the word imagine. \nWebster took a more phonetic approach to the development of his dictionary.  Interestingly, the word didnt appear when Webster published his dictionary in 1828 at the age of seventy. However, of the 70,000 entries, the word phonics is one. The dictionary sold 2500 copies. In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes. Websters 1828 Dictionary is available online.

From the horse, the mule inherits beauty, athletic ability, courage, vigor and speed. Mules appear to require less food than a horse of similar size.\nAccording to the American Mule Museum:\n\nGeorge Washington played the significant role in the development of the mule population in America. He recognized the value of the sturdy animal in agriculture and became the first American breeder.\n\n\nDonkeys were already in America, as they came over with the early explorers, but they were quite small. Washington wished to breed the very best mules, but he faced a major obstacle - the Spanish government at that time prohibited the acquisition or exportation of the famous Andalusian donkey. Washington wrote to King Charles of Spain requesting permission to purchase good quality breeding stock. In October of 1785, a ship docked in Boston harbor carrying a gift from King Charles for George Washington - two fine jennies and a 4-year old Spanish jack named, appropriately, Royal Gift.

Johnson, directed that the United States Navys participation occur on Armed Forces Day in May, although, as a civilian organization, the Navy League was not affected by this directive and continued to organize Navy Day celebrations as before.\nIt was then in the 1970s that the birthday of the Continental Navy was found to be October 13, 1775, and CNO Admiral Elmo R.

In many parts of the world, the Christian religious observances of All Hallows Eve, including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead, remain popular. Although, in other locations, these solemn customs are less pronounced in favor of a more commercialized and secularized celebration. Because many Western Christian denominations encourage, although no longer require, abstinence from meat on All Hallows Eve, the tradition of eating certain vegetarian foods for this vigil day developed, including the consumption of apples, colcannon, cider, potato pancakes, and soul cakes.\nUse #Halloween to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nDating back to an ancient pagan harvest festival marking the end of summer and beckoning the beginning of winter, seasons overlapped during Samhain (pronounced sah-win) and revelers believed the worlds of the living and the dead crossed. To interact with the spirits, the living would wear costumes and light bright bonfires to help protect them.\nSimilar celebrations honoring the dead took place in Roman traditions which were gradually blended and soon replaced the Celtic ceremonies.  All Martyrs Day established by Pope Boniface IV in 609 A.D. was eventually moved by Pope Gregory III to November 1 which later became known as All Saints Day. The eve of this celebration became known as All Hallows Eve or Halloween.\nThrough the Colonial era in America, Halloween celebrations were considered taboo due to religious beliefs.

As Americas favorite flavor, chocolate is well deserving of its own day of honor and celebration.  (Some sources designate July 7 or December 28 as Chocolate Day or International Chocolate Day.)\nHow is chocolate made?\nChocolate comes from the seed of the tropical Theobroma cacao tree.  Cacao, which has been cultivated for at least three millennia, is grown in Mexico, Central America and Northern South America.  The earliest known documentation of using cacao seeds is from around 1100 BC.  The cacao tree seeds have a very intense, bitter taste that must be fermented to develop the flavor.\nOnce the seeds have been fermented, the beans are dried, cleaned and roasted.  After roasting, the shell is removed to produce cacao nibs.  The cacao nibs are then ground into cocoa mass, which is pure chocolate in rough form.   The cocoa mass is usually liquefied then molded with or without other ingredients. At this point in the process, it is called chocolate liquor.  The chocolate liquor may then be processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.\n\nUnsweetened baking chocolate -  cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions.\nSweet chocolate -  cocoa solids, cocoa butter or other fat and sugar.\nMilk chocolate - sweet chocolate with milk powder or condensed milk.\nWhite chocolate - cocoa butter, sugar and milk but no cocoa solids.\n\nResearch has found that chocolate, when eaten in moderation, can lower blood pressure.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nGo out to your favorite restaurant and indulge in a delicious chocolate dessert or try one of these recipes at home:\nChocolate Lasagna\nFudge\nNo Bake Chocolate Oat Bars\nUse #NationalChocolateDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nNational Chocolate Day was created by the National Confectioners Association.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

Upon receiving her letter, Bacheller sent her an autographed copy of another story, and it was then that McPherson realized that she would never be able to thank him adequately for his gift.  McPerson decided to show her appreciation by submitting an idea for a National Authors Day to the General Federation of Womens Clubs.

This day honors one of Americas most popular lunch items.\n \nWhile the modern sandwich is believed to be named after John Montagu, the exact circumstances of its invention and original use are the subject of debate.  There is a rumor in a contemporary travel book titled Tour to London, by Pierre Jean Grosley, that formed the popular myth that bread and meat sustained Lord Sandwich at the gambling table.  It is said that Lord Sandwich was a very conversant gambler and did not take the time to have a meal during his long hours playing at the card table.  When hungry, he would ask his servants to bring him slices of meat between two slices of bread.  This practice was a habit which was well known to his gambling friends who soon began to order the same as Sandwich, and from this, the sandwich was born.\nN.A.M. Rodger, who wrote Sandwichs biography, suggests that because of Sandwichs commitment to the navy, politics and the arts the first sandwich was more likely to have been consumed at his work desk.\nBefore being known as sandwiches, the food seems just to have been known as bread and meat or bread and cheese.\nSome of the most common sandwiches include BLT - Cheese Sandwich - Philadelphia Cheesesteak - Club Sandwich - Dagwood - French Dip - Hamburger - Monte Cristo - Muffuletta - Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich - Pilgrim - Poboy - Reuben - Sloppy Joe - Submarine - Tuna Fish Sandwich - Veggie Sandwich - Deli Sandwich\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nCheck out the Surprise page for National Sandwich Day deals.

According to Gregory, he punched a hole in the center of dough with the ships tin pepper box and later taught the technique to his mother.\nAnthropologist Paul R Mullins states the first cookbook mentioning doughnuts was an 1803 English volume which included doughnuts in an appendix of American recipes.\nAn 1808 short story describing a spread of fire-cakes and dough-nuts is the earliest known recorded usage of the term doughnut.\nA more commonly cited first written recording of the word is Washington Irvings reference to doughnuts in 1809 in his History of New York.

When Anaya was asked what the dish was called, he replied, Nachos especiales.  As the word of this new creation traveled, people tried them, loved them and over time, the name changed and Nachos specials became special nachos.\nThe original recipe is printed in the 1954 St. Annes Cookbook. \nThe popularity of the new dish spread swiftly throughout Texas and the Southwest and has since gained millions of fans across America.\nNachos with an abundance of toppings are often called loaded nachos, super nachos or nachos supreme.\nSome favorite nachos toppings are refried beans, ground beef, shredded beef, chicken, seafood, shredded cheese, jalapeno peppers, green pepper,  lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, onion, sour cream and guacamole.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nPrepare some nachos to enjoy and use #NationalNachosDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nWithin our research, we were unable to find the creator of National Nachos Day.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

A Harvey Wallbanger is made with 3 parts vodka, 1 part Galliano and 6 parts orange juice, poured it into a highball glass and garnished with an orange slice and a maraschino cherry.\n \n \nA story circulating at a chili tasting in 1968 in San Diego where Harvey Wallbangers were served explained the origin of the cocktail as the result of a party in Laguna Beach where the only remaining supplies were vodka, Galliano and orange juice. When the party goers left, Harvey remained, banging his head against the wall.\nHowever, accepted lore credits the invention of the cocktail to the three-time-world-champion bartender, Donato Duke Antone who operated Dukes Blackwatch Bar on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Antone over the years collected quite a few credits for famous beverages. The bartenders resume speaks volumes as the inventor of the Rusty Nail, White Russian and Flaming Russian. According to the bartending wizard, in 1952, a surfer named Tony Wallbanger inspired the cocktail. Perhaps, the party in Laguna Beach is a version of the Antones, but no one has been able to identify the inspirational surfer.\nHarvey Wallbanger remained a quiet little secret in the San Diego area until around 1968 when William Young and George Bednar launched him (or it) onto the international scene. Marketing director for McKesson Imports Company (maker of Galliano), Bednar alongside graphic artist Bill Young, developed a successful marketing campaign around the Harvey Wallbanger character that exploded in late 1969 and the early 1970s.\nHarvey Wallbanger is the name and I can be made! ~ 1969 Galliano marketing slogan\nThe drinks name has become a metaphor to describe someone who goofs off or makes mistakes.

Mark the calendar for Microtia Awareness Day for November 9th and think of the number 9 as the shape of an ear.\n \nApproximately one child in every 9,000 is born with Microtia (when the ear(s) do not fully develop during the 1st trimester of pregnancy).  Often affecting one ear or both ears, Microtia is diagnosed at birth, but there is no understanding as to why Microtia occurs. Facial challenges, hearing loss and the longing for social acceptance are some of the daily concerns for those who are born with Microtia.\nFor most parents, the day of their childs birth turns from celebration to concern and uncertainty.  Initially, aside from the arrival of their beautiful new baby, they notice the outward signs of the condition - a small, curiously shaped ear or no ear at all.  Depending on where these families live, doctors and nurses may be well versed in the condition and quickly educate and prepare parents, reassuring them. In others regions, the condition is rare enough that misinformation or lack of information quickly evaporates any remaining sense of celebration that accompanies a birth. Often when answers arent forthcoming, hopes and dreams become overshadowed by unnecessary challenges to a joyous occasion. There are options and support! It is the intention of Microtia Awareness Day to help promote public awareness and the hope that future generations of families will leave the hospital armed with more answers than questions and their dreams for their child intact.\nChildren are born into this world not knowing they are any different from anyone else. Many with Microtia share similar stories of curious stares, bullying, or awkwardness.  Individual personalities, social conditioning, available treatments and bullying all impact how every child develops and copes as an adult.  By removing unnecessary boundaries and replacing them with resources, tools, and support, we can eliminate bullying and clear the way for an even more successful future.\nIn addition to self-acceptance and loving oneself, advancements in technology can improve the lives of those with Microtia. From hearing aids and implants to surgical procedures and bio-ears that create new outer ears, all these improvements require research.  Research requires time, trials and support. Even the untapped potential of 3-D printing is promising!\nThose with Microtia are an amazing community of people.  Their stories repeatedly tell that with and without technology, medical procedures or innovative research, the most significant advancement of all is human support, awareness, and acceptance.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nUse #MicrotiaAwarenessDay to share on social media.\n[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement(audio);</script><![endif]\nhttp://www.nationaldaycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ear-Community-Dot-Org-Microtia-Awareness-Day.mp3\nHISTORY\nThe Ear Community Organization founded Microtia Awareness Day in 2016 and was submitted by the Tumblin family. Melissa Tumblin founded Ear Community in 2010 after stumbling through the hurdles and challenges of finding answers for her daughter when she was born with Microtia. Since then, Ear Community has brought over 6,500 people together from around the world at the organizations events making it possible to share experiences and resources. The community is made up of not only children and adults with Microtia and their families, but teachers, advocates, and medical professionals from around the world who foster awareness and assistance for this amazing group of people.

Scrapple is arguably the first pork food invented in America. For those who are not familiar with scrapple, which is also known by the Pennsylvania Dutch name pon haus, it is traditionally a mush of pork scraps and trimmings combined with cornmeal, wheat flour and spices.  (The spices may include, but are not limited to: sage, thyme, savory and black pepper.)  The mush is then formed into a semi-solid loaf, sliced and pan-fried.\nThe immediate ancestor of scrapple was the Low German dish called panhas, which was adapted to make use of locally available ingredients and, in parts of Pennsylvania, it is still called Pannhaas, panhoss, ponhoss or pannhas.\nIt was in the 17th and 18th centuries that the first recipes for scrapple were created by Dutch colonists who settled near Philadelphia and Chester County, Pennsylvania.   Hence the origin of its discovery, it is strongly associated with rural areas surrounding Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C., eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, eastern Virginia and the Delmarva Peninsula.\n\nScrapple can be found in supermarkets throughout the area in both refrigerated and frozen cases.\nHome recipes for beef, chicken and turkey scrapple are available.\nScrapple is sometimes deep fried or broiled instead of pan frying.\nScrapple is typically eaten as a breakfast side dish.\nCondiments are sometimes served with scrapple, some of which include apple butter, ketchup, jelly, maple syrup, honey, horseradish or mustard.\n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nHave some scrapple.

The Continental Congress first established the Continental Marines on November 10, 1775, leading up to the American Revolution.  Two battalions of Marines fought for independence both on land and at sea. \n\nThe birth of the U.S. Marine Corps began as a way to augment naval forces in the Revolutionary War.  The recruiting headquarters was in the Tun Tavern on Water Street in Philadelphia, which is considered to be the birthplace of the Marines.\n\nThe Corps was abolished at the end of the Revolutionary War.  However, on July 11, 1798, Congress ordered the creation of the Corps, named it the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and directed that it be available for service under the Secretary of the Navy.\nThe USMC shares many resources with the other branches of the United States military. However, the Corps has sought to maintain its own identity with regards to mission, funding and assets while utilizing the support available from the larger military branches. While the Marine Corps does have fewer installations than other branches, many Army posts, Naval stations and Air Force bases have a Marine presence.\nIn his birthday greeting more than 70 years ago, General Alexander Vandegrift, our 18th Commandant noted that A birthday is a fitting time to peer backward - and forward. That year, Marines reflected on an extraordinary year in combat during their amphibious drive across the Pacific. Despite the challenges and the horrific conditions, Marines prevailed at Guam, Saipan, and Peleliu. On 10 November 1944, Marines looked back with pride on their accomplishment - confident in their ability to meet future challenges.\nIn 2004, 20,000 Marines deployed to Al Anbar Province, Iraq - many Marines celebrated the birthday in places like Fallujah, Ramadi, and Al Qaim while decisively engaged in combat. That year, Marines also responded to the crisis in the Pacific following a tsunami which claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people. On 10 November 2004, Marines looked back with pride on their accomplishments - confident in their ability to meet future challenges.\nSome things change.  We have adapted our organization, training, and equipment to the ever-changing operating environment. Some things remain the same. Marines continue to attack challenges with the same courage, commitment, loyalty, self-sacrifice and adaptability as their predecessors in Peleliu and Fallujah.

Use #MarineCorpsBirthday to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nIn 1921, General John Archer Lejeune, 13th Commandant of the Marine Corps, initiated the tradition of publishing a reminder of honorable service to all Marine commands on the anniversary of the Corps birth.\nSince then, the United States Marine Corps Birthday has been honored by its members every year by republishing General Lejeunes reminder. Gradually, balls and banquets were added to the birthday celebration.\nThe first formal dance took place in 1923 at the Ft. Mifflin Marine Barracks in Pennsylvania. Mock battles, sporting events and races have occurred as well.\nIn 1925, the historic Benjamin Franklin Hotel hosted the first formal Marine Ball in honor of the 150th birthday of the Marine Corp.

The oldest known record of an ice cream sundae is an advertisement in the Ithica Daily Journal dated October 5, 1892, with the conventional day of the week spelling - Sunday.  It has been hotly debated where the sundae originated.  There has been a friendly rivalry between Ithica, New York, and Two Rivers, Wisconsin over which city is the true birthplace of the sundae.  \nThe Two Rivers claim is that in 1881, Druggist Edward Berners served the sweet concoction when customer George Hallauer ordered an ice cream soda.  Because it was the Sabbath, ice cream sodas were prohibited at that time.  As a compromise, Berners served the ice cream in a dish without soda and topped it with chocolate syrup.  This story is disputed by some because Berners would have only been 18 at the time the story takes place.\nIn Ithica on a Sunday after church in 1892, Chester Platt, proprietor of Platt & Colt Pharmacy, and the Reverend John M. Scott stopped at the pharmacy to enjoy a bowl of ice cream.  Instead of just plain vanilla, Platt topped the scoops with cherry syrup and a candied cherry.  The dessert looked and tasted so delightful it required its own name.  It was named for the day it was created.

Although it was initially made with wheat, they substituted cornmeal due to a shortage of the grain at the time. The colonists had learned how to cultivate maize (corn) from the indigenous peoples. Indian pudding was derived from their name for cornmeal, Indian meal.  Milk was substituted for water, and they added either molasses or maple syrup along with cinnamon, ground ginger, butter, eggs, raisins and nuts. Indian pudding is then slowly baked for several hours, transforming its texture from the original porridge-like quality of hasty pudding to a much smoother texture which is more typical of custard.\n\nIndian pudding was found in most American cookbooks before 1900.\n20th-century commercial puddings with industrially perfect creamy consistency replaced the popularity of  Indian pudding.\nThe long cooking time required for Indian pudding did not appeal to 20th century home cooks.\nIndian pudding is still associated with autumn holidays and is occasionally served by some restaurants.\nVanilla ice cream or whipped cream are usually served with Indian pudding.\n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nEnjoy this  Slow Cooker Indian Pudding Recipe.\nUse #NationalIndianPuddingDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nWithin our research, we were unable to find the creator and the origin of National Indian Pudding Day.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

Disney Bros. Studio took their leave of both the studio and Oswald and set to work creating a character who would go on to lead the company into the future.\nFrom a rabbit named Oswald to a mouse named Mortimer, eventually the squeaky voiced rodent was dubbed Mickey. He flopped in two animated short films without any success. Then on November 18, 1928, Mickeys star was born. The first animation synchronized to music and sound effects, Steamboat Willie premiered in New York.\nWithin a year, a Mickey Mouse Club popped up in Salem, Oregon. This particular club offered admission as a fundraiser for the Salvation Army with a donation of either a potato or a small toy and a penny. According to a December 22, 1929, Statesman Journal (Salem, Oregon) article, $12 and three truckloads of potatoes and toys collected by eager new members.\nRemember, the stock market crashed just 20 days before Mickey Mouse was born. That a cute little mouse could bring smiles to the faces of children at an uncertain time really isnt such a surprise.\nGenerally, new members joined the club by completing an admission form obtained from a local merchant and attending meetings held during matinees at local movie houses. The price of admission often was reduced for good deeds and report cards. By the end of 1930, the Mickey Mouse Clubs had spread across the country.\nIn 1935, animator Fred Moore gave Mickey a new look that enabled a more fluid movement to the animation.\nA makeover in 1935 by animator Fred Moore gave Mickey the look we are familiar with today. The big eyes, white gloves and the pert little nose. More lovable than ever before, he propelled himself even further into the hearts of children everywhere.\nHis companions Minnie, Donald, Goofy and Pluto joined him along the way, bringing vaudevillian comedy with them.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

The flowers are small, starting out pale green then turning reddish with each one having five slender, acute petals.\nThe largest cashew tree in the world covers about 81,000 sq. ft. and is located in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.\n\n\nThe cashew tree has a fruit called the cashew apple.  Its fragile skin makes it unsuitable for transport.\nLatin Americans make a fruit drink from the cashew apple. \nThe Cashew causes fewer allergic reactions than other nuts or peanuts.\nAlthough native to northeast Brazil, the Portuguese took the cashew plant to Goa, India, between 1560 and 1565.  From Goa, it spread throughout Southeast Asia and eventually Africa.\nWe often see peanuts, pecans, walnuts and other nuts sold in the shell.  Due to the toxic nature of the cashew nuts shell, this is not possible. \nSpeaking of the shell, the Cashew is not a true nut.

This modern view of espresso is due to the advent of the espresso machine. In 1901, the first successful espresso machine was invented by Italian inventor Luigi Bezzera. The newer technologies produced a smaller, more concentrated cup more quickly than more traditional coffee brewing methods.\nThis thicker, more intense brew creates a creamy foam on top called the crema.

In the spring, the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap.  The maple trees are then tapped by boring holes into their trunks and the released sap is collected.  After the sap is collected, it is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.\nMaple syrup was first collected, processed and used by the indigenous peoples of North America.  The practice was then adopted by the European settlers who gradually refined production methods.  In the 1970s further refinements in the syrup processing were made with technological improvements.\n\nA maple syrup production farm is called a sugarbush or a sugarwood.\nSap is boiled in a sugar house which is also known as a sugar shack, sugar shanty or a cabane   sucre.\n\nUp until the 1930s the United States led in maple syrup production, now Canada is the worlds largest maple syrup producer.\nVermont is the largest producer of maple syrup in the United States.\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nUse #MapleSyrupDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nNational Day Calendar has not been able to determine the origin of National Maple Syrup Day.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

The President is requested each year to issue a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n \n \nWright Brothers Day is an annual United States national observation.  It is codified in the US Code and Wright Brothers Day commemorates the first successful flights in a heavier than air, mechanically propelled airplane, that were made by Orville and Wilbur Wright on December 17, 1903, near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.\nThe Wright brothers were American brothers, inventors and aviation pioneers. \nOrville Wright\n  ( August 19, 1871 - January 30, 1948 )\nWilbur Wright\n  ( April 16, 1867 - May 30, 1912 )\n \nPresidential Proclamation   Wright Brothers Day, 2014\nWRIGHT BROTHERS DAY, 2014\n  -\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\nA PROCLAMATION\nThe United States has always been a land of exploration and innovation. Determined to build a Nation where all things were possible, our countrys Founders crossed a vast ocean and launched an improbable experiment in democracy. Early pioneers pushed west across sweeping plains. Dreamers toiled with hearts and hands to build cities, lay railroads, and power an automobile revolution. And on December 17, 1903, two brothers from Dayton, Ohio, would write their own chapter in Americas long history of discovery and achievement.\nAfter years of painstaking research and careful engineering, Orville and Wilbur Wright accomplished what was once unthinkable: the worlds first powered flight. Above the sand dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, they revolutionized modern transportation and extended the reach of humanity. Their inspiring feat opened the door to more than a century of progress and helped spark a new era of economic growth and prosperity. Today, we celebrate those 12 seconds of flight that changed the course of human events, and the determination and perseverance that made that moment possible.\nAmerica has always succeeded because as a Nation, we refuse to stand still. As heirs to this proud legacy of risk takers and dreamers who imagined the world as it could be, we must constantly work to empower the next generation of inventors and entrepreneurs. That is why my Administration is investing in programs that encourage science, technology, engineering, and math education, especially for traditionally underrepresented groups. And we are fighting to ensure that innovators and startups have the resources and opportunities they need to build the future they seek.\nOur Nation brought the world everything from the light bulb to the Internet, and today   in laboratories and classrooms across America   our scientists and students carry forward this tradition as they work to develop new sources of energy and code the computer programs of tomorrow. Less than seven decades after Orville and Wilburs flying machine lifted into the air, American ingenuity brought us to Tranquility Base   and as the lunar module touched down on the surface of the Moon, it carried with it pieces of the brothers historic airplane. Today, the Wright brothers spirit lives on in the aspirations of a resolute people   to cure disease, walk on distant planets, and solve the biggest challenges of our time.\nOn Wright Brothers Day, we lift up the scientists, entrepreneurs, inventors, builders, and doers of today, and all those who reach for the future. Let us recommit to harnessing the passion and creativity of every person who works hard in America and leading the world through another century of discovery.\nThe Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of each year as Wright Brothers Day and has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2014, as Wright Brothers Day.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand fourteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-ninth.\nBARACK OBAMA\nHOW TO OBSERVE\nUse #WrightBrothersDay to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nThe Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of each year as Wright Brothers Day and has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

Use #ChristmasEve to post on social media.\nHISTORY\nHearkening back to 16th century when Christian traditions were first influenced by winter solstice celebrations, decorating and preparing for Christmas Day took place the evening before.  This included putting up the tree, decorating with mistletoe and holly, bringing in the Yule log and making dishes for the Christmas meal.\nJewish traditions have historically influenced Christian practices.  One such practice is that the church day traditionally begins in the evening. Christian churches have celebrated Christmas Eve in part because it is believed that Jesus was born at midnight. Many churches today hold Christmas Eve services or Midnight Masses. They may also hold candlelight vigils, Nativity productions or sing carols.\nThere are over 1,200 national days.

A century later pumpkin pie recipes began to appear in American cookbooks.\nPumpkin pie became a familiar addition to the Thanksgiving dinner in the early seventeenth-century when the pilgrims brought it back to New England. Initially, the pumpkin pie was prepared by stuffing the pumpkin with apples, spices and sugar then baking it whole.\nThere are many seasonal pumpkin pie flavored products that are now available including, ice cream, pudding, coffee, lattes, cheesecake, pancakes, candy and beer.\nIn the 1844 Thanksgiving poem, Over the River and Through the Wood written by Lydia Maria Child, there is a reference to pumpkin pie in one of its verses: Hurrah for the fun!

Some point to the song of Good King Wenceslas as the source of spirit, if not the day itself. According to the song, the 10th-century Duke looked out on his land on St. Stephens Day (which is celebrated on December 26) and observed a poor peasant. He ordered food, wine and wood for fuel to be taken to the peasant and called for all Christian men to bless the poor in the same way.\nIn the Church of England, it was traditional during Advent for churches to display a donation box. After Christmas, the contents of the box were distributed among the poor.\nAmong the aristocrats, it was traditional to give boxed gifts to their servants and employees.\nMost of the events on modern Boxing Day have little to do with the charity in the stories mentioned.

From the elaborate Mamluk designs of Egypt to the appearance of the first playing cards during the Early Renaissance in Europe, the decks were divided into four suits of coins, cups, swords and sticks or batons.\nIt is from these four suits that todays modern decks of playing cards developed. Theories range how the suits converted to hearts, spades, diamonds and clubs. One theory suggests the suits represent the different classes of the era - clergy, aristocracy, military and peasantry.\nIn India, the ten suited card game of Ganjifa became popular during the Moghul period.
